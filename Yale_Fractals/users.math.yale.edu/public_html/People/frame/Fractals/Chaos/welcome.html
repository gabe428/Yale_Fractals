<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Deterministic Chaos</H1><P>Deterministic chaos may sound like an oxymoron, but this is due to mistaking the popular and mathematical notions of "chaos."  According to the descendants of Mr. Webster, chaos derives from the Greek word for abyss and means, "(a) <B>a state of things in which chance is supreme</B>; esp: the confused unorganized state of primordial matter before the creation of distinct forms (b) <B>a state of utter confusion</B>."  That is, as a popular concept chaos is equivalent to randomneess.  This is absolutely not the case for the mathematical notion of chaos.  To emphaize the difference, we sometimes refer to this mathematical sense of chaos as deterministic chaos.</P><P><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>A</B>. <A HREF="Doubling/Doubling.html">The unbearable quickness of doubling</A>: iteration of even the humble number 2 can reach from a grain of rice to the stars.

Slightly more complicated dynamics can lead to MUCH more complicated behavior.  For such systems, small differences in the initial conditions can grow into large changes in later values.  This is <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">sensitivity to initial conditions</FONT>, one of the attributes of <A HREF="ChaosIntro/ChaosIntro.html">chaos</A>.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="ChaosIntro/ChaosIntroS.html" WIDTH=129 HEIGHT=90></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>C</B>. The <A HREF="TestFcns/TestFcns.html">test functions</A> for our study of chaos: the logistic map and the tent map.  The logistic map is defined by a parabola, the tent map by a broken line, both symmetric about x = 1/2.  For both, the height of the maximum point is varied to define a family of functions.  The height gives the family <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">parameter</FONT>.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="TestFcns/TestFcnsS.html" WIDTH=205 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>D</B>. Given a function f(x) and an initial point x<SUB>0</SUB>, the <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">orbit</FONT> of x<SUB>0</SUB> is the sequence x<SUB>1</SUB>=f(x<SUB>0</SUB>), x<SUB>2</SUB>=f(x<SUB>1</SUB>), ... .  Here are seven ways to visualize the long-term behavior of the orbit.  These can be used to analyze any sequence of values, including experimental data.</TD> <TD VALIGN="TOP"></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>D.1</B>. <A HREF="GrIter/GrIter-2.html">Graphical iteration</A> produces the orbit by generating the points <NOBR>(x<SUB>0</SUB>,x<SUB>1</SUB>)</NOBR>, <NOBR>(x<SUB>1</SUB>,x<SUB>2</SUB>)</NOBR>, <NOBR>(x<SUB>2</SUB>,x<SUB>3</SUB>)</NOBR>, ... .

The <A HREF="TimeSeries/TimeSeries.html">time series</A> is the plot of orbit values in order.  That is, it is the graph of the points <NOBR>(0,x<SUB>0</SUB>)</NOBR>, <NOBR>(1,x<SUB>1</SUB>)</NOBR>, <NOBR>(2,x<SUB>2</SUB>)</NOBR>, ... .  When many points are plotted, the ordering can be emphasized by drawing lines connecting successive points.  This is one of the most common ways to visualize temporal patterns in data.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="TimeSeries/TimeSeriesS.gif" WIDTH=84 HEIGHT=101></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>D.3</B>. A <A HREF="OrbHist/OrbHist.html">histogram</A> of the orbit is obtained first by dividing the range <NOBR>[orbit min, orbit max]</NOBR> into bins, represented vertically to be compatible with graphical iteration.  Each orbit point belongs to some bin, and as the orbit is followed, each point augments the horizontal line drawn from the bin to which the point belongs.  The histogram gives a rough measure of the amount of time the orbit spends in each region of the range.</TD>    <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="OrbHist/TentHistS.gif" WIDTH=84 HEIGHT=94></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>D.4</B>. The <A HREF="BifDiag/BifDiag.html">bifurcation diagram</A> is a record of the eventual orbit values (plotted vertically) for each of a sequence of parameter values (plotted horizontally).  This gives a record of how the dynamics change as the parameter varies.</TD>      <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="TLBifDiag/LogBifS.gif" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=109></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>D.5</B>. The <A HREF="ReturnMap/ReturnMap.html">return map</A> is a plot of points <NOBR>(x<SUB>0</SUB>,x<SUB>1</SUB>)</NOBR>, <NOBR>(x<SUB>1</SUB>,x<SUB>2</SUB>)</NOBR>, <NOBR>(x<SUB>2</SUB>,x<SUB>3</SUB>)</NOBR>, <NOBR>(x<SUB>3</SUB>,x<SUB>4</SUB>)</NOBR>, ... .  For orbits of functions x<SUB>i+1</SUB> = f(x<SUB>i</SUB>), the return map just produces points on the graph y = f(x).  So for experimental data, the return map shows how well the data can be represented by one-dimensional dynamics.</TD>    <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="ReturnMap/ReturnS.gif" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=110></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>D.6</B>. For the <A HREF="DrIFS/DRIFS-2.html">driven IFS plot</A>, the range <NOBR>[orbit min, orbit max]</NOBR> is divided into four bins and the corners of the unit square are numbered 1 through 4.  Starting from <NOBR>(1/2,1/2)</NOBR>, the plot consists of points p<SUB>0</SUB>, p<SUB>1</SUB>, ... , where p<SUB>i+1</SUB> is the midpoint of p<SUB>i</SUB> and the corner numbered for the bin in which p<SUB>i</SUB> falls.</TD>    <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="DrIFS/LogDrIFSS.gif" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=110></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>D.7</B>. For a <A HREF="KellyPlot/KellyPlot.html">Kelly plot</A>, the range <NOBR>[orbit min, orbit max]</NOBR> is divided into some number, N, of bins and a color is assigned to each bin.  Then small squares are colored sequentially, the color of each square is that of the bin into which the corresponding orbit point falls.  With some practice, this method can give a good visual test for uniform and Gaussian randomness, for intermittency, and other dynamics.</TD>  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="KellyPlot/LogKellyS.gif" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=110></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Some dynamical behaviors can be predicted.  Here are two examples.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>E</B>. <A HREF="FixedPoints/FixedPoints.html">Fixed points</A> are points x<SUB>*</SUB> left unchanged by the dynamics: f(x<SUB>*</SUB>) = x<SUB>*</SUB> for sequences generated by iterating a function f(x).  For graphical iteration, fixed points are seen as the intersections of y = f(x) and y = x.  The time series of a fixed point is a horizontal line.  Fixed points are <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">stable</FONT> or <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">unstable</FONT> according as nearby points approach or recede from the fixed point.</TD>    <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="FixedPoints/StableFP/StableFPS.gif" WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=94></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>F</B>. An N-<A HREF="Cycles/Cycles.html">cycle</A> is a collection of points x<SUB>1</SUB>, x<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., x<SUB>N</SUB>, that occur sequentially, with x<SUB>N</SUB> followed by x<SUB>1</SUB> and the pattern repeating.  For sequences generated by iterating a function f(x), the cycle is determined by x<SUB>2</SUB> = f(x<SUB>1</SUB>), x<SUB>3</SUB> = f(x<SUB>2</SUB>), ..., x<SUB>1</SUB> = f(x<SUB>N</SUB>).  These cycles are intersections of y = x and y = f<SUP>N</SUP>(x) = f(f(...f(x)...)).  Stability of a cycle is analogous to that of a fixed point.</TD>  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="Cycles/CycleS.gif" WIDTH=102 HEIGHT=102></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>G</B>. As a system parameter is varied, dynamics can become more complicated through <A HREF="PeriodDoublingBif/PeriodDoublingBif.html">period-doubling</A> bifurcations.  At the parameter value where an N-cycle becomes unstable, a stable 2N-cycle appears: each point of the cycle gives rise to two points of the 2N-cycle.  As the parameter value continues to increase, the 2N-cycle becomes unstable, and each point gives rise to two points of a stable 4N-cycle, and so on.</TD>  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="PeriodDoublingBif/PerDoubBifS.html" WIDTH=102 HEIGHT=102></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>H</B>. What happens after all these period-doublings?  This is the first appearance of <A HREF="ChaosDef/ChaosDef.html">chaos</A>.  In addition to sensitivity to initial conditions, chaos has two other attributes.  It is filled with cycles, all of them unstable, and every region eventually visits every other region.</TD>  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="ChaosDef/ChaosDefS.html" WIDTH=141 HEIGHT=141></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>I</B>. What happens when the top of the graph of the function iterated is higher than the top of the unit square?  Almost all points escape the unit square, but those that do not form a familiar <A HREF="TentDust/TentDust.html">fractal</A>, a Cantor set.  On this Cantor set, the dynamics are chaotic.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="TentDust/TentDustS.gif" WIDTH=97 HEIGHT=114></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>J</B>. All the various dynamics of the tent map and of the logistic map can be assembled into the <A HREF="TLBifDiag/TLBifDiag.html">Tent and Logistic Bifurcation Diagrams</A>.  Both exhibit chaos, but the tent diagram is much simpler: the logistic diagram contains infinitely many windows of stable cycles.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="TLBifDiag/TLBifS.html" WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=110></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>K</B>. The periodic windows in the logostic bifurcation diagram open through <A HREF="TangentBif/TangentBif.html">tangent</A> bifurcations.  As the parameter increases, the minima of f<SUP>n</SUP>(x) decrease until they touch y = x, forming points of a new cycle.  With increasing parameter, the minima decrease, giving rise to a pair of points, one stable, one unstable.  So tangent bifurcations give rise to a pair of cycles, one stable, the other unstable.</TD>   <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="TangentBif/TangentBifS.html" WIDTH=102 HEIGHT=102></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>L</B>. Just before a periodic window opens, the orbit clusters into clumps around the cycle of the window.  This is <A HREF="Intermittency/Intermittency.html">Intermittency</A>.  The time series appears to follow close to an n-cycle for some time, then takes an apparently random excursion, only to return to the n-cycle.  Graphical iteration of f<SUP>n</SUP>(x) reveals the cause of this behavior.  Intermittency is observed in many physical systems.</TD>    <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="Intermittency/IntermittencyS.html" WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=128></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>M</B>. Breaking the tent map into a discontinuous function and bending part of the graph gives a much more <A HREF="DiscBifDiag/DiscBifDiag.html">interesting</A> bifurcation diagram.  The right side of the diagram looks much like that of the tent map, but the left side exhibits a sequence of periodic windows interwoven in the <A HREF="../MandelSet/MandelCombinatorics/MandelCombinatorics.html">same order</A> as the discs attached around the cardioid of the Mandelbrot set.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="DiscBifDiag/DiscBifS.gif" WIDTH=165 HEIGHT=111></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>N</B>. Investigations of the distances between successive period-doubling bifurcations led to the discovery of a new kind of <A HREF="Feigenbaum/Feigenbaum.html">scaling</A>, and a new mathematical constant.  Presaging the next section, this constant is universal in the sense that it arises in a large class of functions.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="Feigenbaum/FeigenbaumS.gif" WIDTH=141 HEIGHT=111></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>O</B>. Against the objections that the logistic map is a very special case, we offer the <A HREF="LogUniv/LogUniv.html">universality</A> of the logistic map dynamics.  A large collection of functions exhibit behavior qualitatively, and in some ways quantitatively, identical to that of the logistic map.  Moreover, this is observed in many experiments.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="LogUniv/LogUnivS.gif" WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=72></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>P</B>. How can we understand this universality?  The process called <A HREF="Renormalization/Renormalization.html">renormalization</A> shows that higher iterates of the logistic map contain small copies of the whole map.  Now what would this have to do with fractals?  Some of the ideas of renormalization developed in statistical mechanics and have been applied in the study of phase transitions.  For example, at high enough pressure as water vapor nears its condensation temperature, droplets of liquid water can coexist with the vapor.  Droplets of many sizes form, and the mixture suddenly switches from transparent to milky.  This is called critical opalescence.  Pressures of over 200 atm and temperatures above 600 F are needed to observe this, so don't try it at home.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="Renormalization/logRenormS.html" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=150></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Q</B>. <A HREF="TLDrIFS/TLDrIFS.html">IFS driven</A> by the Tent Map and the Logistic Map reveal a new measure of complexity.  In some instances, the pattern is identical to that produced by a random IFS with certain pairs of transformations excluded.  Others require longer excluded combinations (triples, quadruples, etc.)  The number of excluded combinations is this measure of complexity.  Applied to real data, this suggests how many steps in the past are needed to determine the future.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="TLDrIFS/TLDrIFSS.html" WIDTH=129 HEIGHT=129></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>R</B>. <A HREF="TLKelly/TLKelly.html">Kelly plots</A> of the Tent Map and the Logistic Map produce some interesting patterns, but is it art?  Intermittency if clearly seen by this method (as in the picture on the right), and excluded combinations can be detected, though with more work than driven IFS.  On the other hand, some long-range correlations can be more readily seen.  Also, this method has more flexibility in the number of bins assigned to the data.  Driven IFS and Kelly plots complement one another nicely.</TD>  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="TLKelly/TLKellyS.gif" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=150></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>S</B>. Loss of predictability is the bad news of chaos; the good news is a much more robust strategy for <A HREF="ChaosControl/ChaosControl.html">control</A> of chaotic systems.  With occasional, slight modifications of the system parameter, we can stabilize any one of the unstable periodic orbits permeating chaos.  For applications, it is important to note this method can be applied WITHOUT having a mathematical model of the underlying dynamical process.  Experiments with magnetic systems, chemical reactions, and even cardiac arrhythmias, validate this approach.</TD>  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="ChaosControl/ChaosControlS.gif" WIDTH=118 HEIGHT=124></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>T</B>. With some degree of feedback, periodic systems such as pendula, and even some species of fireflies, can synchronize.  Surprisingly,chaotic processes can  <A HREF="Synchronization/Synchronization.html">synchronize</A> as well.  This method has applications in secure communication.</TD>  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="Synchronization/SynchronizationS.html" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=140></TD></TABLE></P></BODY>
