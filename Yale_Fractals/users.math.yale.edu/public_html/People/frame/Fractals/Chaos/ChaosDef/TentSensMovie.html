The tiny amount of energy produced by the flapping of a butterfly's wings cannot, with the passing of time, gather energy and organize it into the substantial energy content of a tornado.  Rather, the flapping of a butterfly's wing injects some uncertainty into the weather system.  That uncertainty grows with time, eventually overwhelming our ability to to predict, when the butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil, if several weeks later Texas will experience a tornado.  This distinction is fairly subtle, but very important, a point often missed in popular descriptions of chaos.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="ChaosDef.html">Mathematical Definition of Chaos</A>.</P></HEAD>
