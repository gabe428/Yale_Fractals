One thing we notice is the big sequence of branches (starting at s = 3) opening to the right.  This is the sequence of period-doubling bifurcations,</P> <UL>where the non-zero fixed point gives rise to a 2-cycle,</UL> <UL>that gives rise to a 4-cycle,</UL> <UL>that gives rise to an 8-cycle, and so on.</UL>  <P>Moreover, at least one of the periodic windows seems to be visible around s = 3.85.
