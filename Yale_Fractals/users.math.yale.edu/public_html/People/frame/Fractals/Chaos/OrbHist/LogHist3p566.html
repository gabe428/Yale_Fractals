Taking into account the interpretation of thick lines as nearby points in the cycle, this might appear to be a 15-cycle: five horizontal lines two pixels thick, five horizontal lines one pixel thick.  However, the top line is twice as long as the others, and corresponds to two distinct points of the orbit, so close they occupy the same pixel in the histogram.  Each time the orbit visits either of these points, the one pixel is added to the corresponding horizontal line of pixels.  That is, this line of pixels grows twice as quickly as the others.  So we are looking at the histogram of a 16-cycle.</TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
