In particular, he is interested in <B>structural scaling</B> of music.  That is, patterns of notes that, in some respect, repeat on successively larger scales.  Often this pattern can manifest itself in subtle ways.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Despite the fact that rigorous analysis of certain aspects of musical structure requires highly specific knowledge of the subject, some patterns can be appreciated on an intuitive level.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Consider that we generally take for granted our ability to perceive cadence and inflection in spoken language; yet these sensitivities fundamentally inform, affect, and color our understanding of what might otherwise be dry written words.</TD></TR><TR><TD>For those with a keen ear or formal training, language of music behaves similarly.</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD>For example, <B>Reel One</B></TD></TR><TR><TD>Many songs across multiple genres are based on a structure in which a first section, <I>A</I>, is repeated and then followed by a <I>B</I> section that is harmonically or rhythmically different from the <I>A</I> section.  These three sections are followed by a final <I>A</I> section.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">A A B A</TD></TR><TR><TD>This AABA template can be used as the generator for a Cantor set.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Cantor1.gif" WIDTH=615 HEIGHT=76></TD></TR><TR><TD>Here is a map of this song showing its three levels of scaling.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Each of the small blue blocks represents one measure (4 beats) of music.</TD></TR><TR><TD>The green and red blocks represent 4 and 16 measures, respectively.</TD></TR><TR><TD>All measures of the same color contain exactly the same, ordered set of notes.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Each gray block of any size contains a set of notes that is different from the colored set to its right and left.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><embed src="reelone.mid" autostart=false  width = "144" height="60"></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P> &copy; 2004 Harlan Brothers</P><P>Return to <A HREF="../OneOverFMusic.html">1/f music</A></P></BODY>
