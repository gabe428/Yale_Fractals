Perhaps Emperor Joseph anticipated the fractal nature of music.  Probably not.)</TD></TR> <TR><TD>They tested this hypothesis on Bach's Invention no. 1 in C Major.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>To understand the motivation, first convert the notes to a graph.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Taking f<SUB>0</SUB> = 60 Hz, the note j intervals above f<SUB>0</SUB> has frequency f<SUB>j</SUB>given by f<SUB>j</SUB>/f<SUB>0</SUB> = (15.9/15)<SUP>j</SUP>.</TD></TR><TR><TD>In this way, an integer j is assignd to each note, and the graph of a composition is the plot of j (vertically) versus i (horizontally), where f<SUB>j</SUB> is the frequency of the i<SUP>th</SUP> note.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Such a plot gives a very jagged graph, and the Hsus observed that similar graphs made with every second note, or with every fourth note, and so on, of the original still sound remarkably Bach-like.</TD></TR><TR><TD>This suggested a method for making new Bach-like compositions: "start with a 1/32 eduction of Bach and ... build the composition up into an alternative score, according to the theory of music harmony."</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Here are the graph of the original, the 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 reduction of BWV 772 of Bach.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Hsu2.gif" WIDTH = 450 HEIGHT=266></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="Hsus.html">Kenneth and Andrew Hsu</A>.</P></BODY>
