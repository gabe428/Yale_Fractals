<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry Panorama</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Martin Gardner</H1><P><TABLE><TR><TD>In his April, 1978 Mathematical Recreations column of <I>Scientific American</I>, Martin Gardner expresses the importance of novelty and familiarity, the two opposing aspects of aesthetic appeal, in this way:</TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER BGCOLOR="FFFBC6"><TR><TD>"It is commonplace in musical criticism to say that we enjoy good music because it offers a mixture of order and surprise.  How could it be otherwise?  Surprise would not be surprise if there were not sufficient order for us to anticipate what is likely to come next.  If we guess too accurately, say in listening to a tune that is no more than walking up and down the keyboard in one-step intervals,  there is no surprise at all. Good music, like a person's life or the pageant of history, is a wonderous mixture of explanation and unanticipated turns.  There is nothing new about this insight, but what Voss has done is to suggest a mathematical measure of the mixture."</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>In the postscript to "White, Brown, and Fractal Music," on pg 393 of <B>The Night is Large</B>, Martin Gardner writes</TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER BGCOLOR="FFFBC6"><TR><TD>"Frank Greenberg called my attention to some 'mountain music' composed by Sergei Prokofiev from Sergei Eisenstein's film <I>Alexander Nevsky</I> in 1938.  'Eisenstein provided Prokfiev with still shots of individual scenes of the movie as it was being filmed.  Prokofiev then took these scenes and used the silhouette of the landscape and human figures as a pattern for the position of the notes on the staff. He then orchestrated around these notes."</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>The natural fractal profile of the mountain range led to Prokofiev's composing fractal music to accompany the film.</TD></TR></TABLE></P> </BODY>
