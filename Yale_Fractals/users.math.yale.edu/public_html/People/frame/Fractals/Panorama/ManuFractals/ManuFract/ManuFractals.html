Technology developed without exploiting iteration across many scales.  Yet the lessons of blind physical forces, and of billions of years of organic evolution, assert the importance of fractals.  Recently, some industries have started exploiting fractal forms.  Here are a few examples.</TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="../FractalAntennas/FractalAntennas.html">Fractal Antennas</A>: a multitude of scales allows for broad-band reception in a compact space.</TD> <TD><IMG SRC="../FractalAntennas/FracTenna1S.html" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="../FractalDrums/FractalDrums.html">Fractal Drums</A>: multiple length scales of the periphery give rise to localized excitations - only a part of the drumhead moves - and to very efficient absorption of sound.</TD> <TD><IMG SRC="../FractalDrums/FracDrum3S.html" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="../FractalFiberoptics/FractalFiberoptics.html">Fractal Fiberoptics</A>  Fractal bundles of optical fibers make waveguides with very low distortion.</TD><TD><IMG SRC="../FractalFiberoptics/FiberOpticsS.html" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="../Internet/Internet.html">Fractal Internet Traffic</A>  Understanding the fractal nature of internet traffic clarifies the design parameters.</TD><TD><IMG SRC="../Internet/InternetSP.html" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="../FractalMixers/FractalMixers.html">Fractal Mixers</A>  Using the design of the lungs, two fluids can be thoroughly mixed with very low turbulence.</TD>  <TD><IMG SRC="../FractalMixers/Mixer2S.gif" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="../ImageCompression/ImageCompression.html">Image Compression</A>  A (localized) variation of Iterated Function Systems has been used to automatically compress images.</TD>    <TD><IMG SRC="../ImageCompression/LenaS.html" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>Perhaps the real blossoming of industrial fractals will come once nanotechnology has developed cell-sized constructors.
