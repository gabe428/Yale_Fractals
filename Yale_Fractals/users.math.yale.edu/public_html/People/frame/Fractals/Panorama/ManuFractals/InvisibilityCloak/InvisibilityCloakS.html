This is the region that will be invisible to outside observers.  Surrounding the boundary layer are six concentric rings that guide microwaves around the boundary layer, to reconverge at the point antipodal to where they entered the cloak.</TD></TR> <TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="invcl22.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=240> &nbsp<IMG SRC="invcl42.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=240></TD></TR> <TR><TD>On the left is a magnification of one of the outer rings of the cloak.  On the right is the boundary layer fractal.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>If fabricated at the sub-micron scale, instead of the current mm scale, this technology should act as an optical invisibility cloak.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>In late August, 2012, Cohen's group cloaked a person.  Interesting times ahead.</TD></TR> </TABLE></P></BODY>
