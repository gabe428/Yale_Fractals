<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry Summer Panorama</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Fractal Fiberoptics</H1><P><TABLE><TR><TD>Appropriately bundled fiberoptics form an optical waveguide of very low distortion.  Using recursive tilings to construct bundles,  Lee Cook of Galileo Electro-Optics Corp. showed the edges of optically useful tilings are fractal.  This led to the design of fractal fiber arrays, called multi-multifibers, with improved image contrast.  The preimeters of these multi-multifibers are similar to the <A HREF="Gosper/GosperCurve.html">Gosper snowflake curve</A>.  Gosper snowflakes tile the plane; and a large Gosper snowflake can be tiled with 7 Gosper snowflakes scaled by 1/sqrt(7) horizontally and vertically.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>A bundle of seven optical fibers (one in the middle, six around the edges) forms a very crude approximation of a Gosper snowflake.  A bundle of seven of these bundles forms a better Gosper snowflake as its perimeter.  Continue this recursive process several steps and a fractal fiberoptic cable results.  On the left  below we see a cross-section of a bundle of seven fibers.  The middle is a bundle of seven bundles (one shaded to show its relative position in the bundle).  The right is a bundle of seven of these bundles.  Notice that the periphery of the increasingly large bundles looks more like the Gosper snowflake.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Gosper/Gosper.gif" WIDTH=386 HEIGHT=216></TD></TR> </TABLE></P></BODY>
