<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry Panorama</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Fractals in Physiology</H1><P><TABLE><TR><TD>Some of the most visually striking examples of fractal forms are found in physiology:  The respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems are remarkable instances of fractal architecture, branches subdividing and subdividing and subdividing again.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Nice pictures are provided in Goldberger, Rigney and West.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Although no clear genetic, enzymic, or biophysical mechanism yet have been shown to be responsible for this fractal structure, few doubt this.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Careful analysis of the lungs reveal fractal scaling, and it has been noted that this fractal structure makes the lungs more fault-tolerant during growth.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Here are three pictures of lung casts, some with the circulatory system casts included. These pictures were provided by Dr. Ewald R. Weibel.</TD></TR></TABLE></P>   <P ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD><A HREF="Lung1.html" TARGET="BLANK"><IMG SRC="Lung1s.gif" WIDTH=273 HEIGHT=227></A></TD><TD><A HREF="Lung2.html" TARGET="BLANK"><IMG SRC="Lung2s.gif" WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=227></A></TD><TD><A HREF="Lung3.html" TARGET="BLANK"><IMG SRC="Lung3s.gif" WIDTH=178 HEIGHT=227></A></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>The heart is filled with fractal networks: the coronary arteries and veins, the fibers binding the valves to the heart wall, the cardiac muscles themselves, and the His-Purkinje system.</P> <P><TABLE><TR><TD>In addition to falut-tolerance during growth, fractal branching makes available much more surface area for absorption and transfer in bronchial tubes, capallaries, intestinal lining, and bile ducts.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Kalda has proposed a fractal model of the blood vessel system that achieves a homogeneous oxygen supply throughout the body.</TD></TR><TR> <TD>Also, the redundancy of fractal structures make them robust against injury. For example, the heart can continue to function even after the His-Purkinje system has suffered considerable damage.</TD></TR></TABLE></P>  <P><TABLE><TR><TD>From his work on the ability of <A HREF="../../ManuFractals/FractalDrums/FractalDrums.html">fractal drums</A> to damp vibrations, Bernard Sapoval deduced another advantage of the fractal character of the circulatory system: "the fractal structure of the human circulatory system damps out the hammer blows that our heart generates."  "The heart is a very violent pump, and if there were any resonance in blood circulation, you would die."</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Fractals may save our lives every minute.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Here are some casts of <A HREF="AnimalLungs/AnimalLungs.html">animal lungs</A>.</P> <P><TABLE><TR><TD>Finally, we note the body exhibits dynamical fractals.</TD></TR><TR><TD> For example, it is well-known that healthy heartbeats are chaotic rather than regular.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>A careful plot of heart rates over several time scales reveals self-similar scaling (Goldberger, Rigney and West).</TD></TR></TABLE></P> </BODY>
