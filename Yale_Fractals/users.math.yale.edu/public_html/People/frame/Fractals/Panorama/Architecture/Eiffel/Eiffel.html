A truss is a rigid assemblage of interconnected submembers, which one cannot deform without deforming at least one submember.  Trusses can be made enormously lighter than cylindrical beams of identical strength.  And Eiffel knew that trusses whose 'members' are themselves subtrusses are even lighter.  See the right picture below.</UL></TD></TR><TR><TD><UL>"The fact that the key to strength lies in branch points, popularized by Buckminster Fuller, was already known to the sophisticated designers of Gothic cathedrals.  The farther we go in applying this principle, the closer we get to a Sierpinski ideal!"</UL></TD></TR><TR><TD>Here are a sketch of the general structure of the tower, along with the plan of a detail showing the cross-braces made of cross-braces.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="Eiffel.gif" WIDTH=185 HEIGHT=263></TD><TD><IMG SRC="EiffelDetail.gif" WIDTH=229 HEIGHT=174></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>Here are two photos showing some of this detail.
