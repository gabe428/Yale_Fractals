Moving around the ring, the buildings become progressively larger dwellings, until the largest, the father's house, is opposite the gate (hence at the back of the pen).</TD></TR><TR><TD>Thus front to back measures a status gradient for the home.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Left is an aerial photograph of a settlement, right a schematic.  Click each picture for an enlargement in a new window.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD><A HREF="javascript:location='BaIla.html';window.open('BaIla1.html','Example1','HEIGHT=340,WIDTH=510,scrollbar=yes')"><IMG SRC="BaIla1S.gif" WIDTH=248 HEIGHT=161></A></TD><TD><A HREF="javascript:location='BaIla.html';window.open('BaIla2.html','Example2','HEIGHT=285,WIDTH=300,scrollbar=yes')"><IMG SRC="BaIla2S.gif" WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=162></A></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>The entire settlement reproduces both the ring structure and the status gradient.</TD></TR><TR><TD>The front of the settlement is the gate.
