Perhaps this is one of the reasons Julia sets are so attractive: these mathematical fractals mimick some of the intricacy familiar from nature.</TD></TR><TR><TD>On the left below <I>Fuji at Sea</I>.

So he had only brief, visual inspection of lightning to guide his drawing.  Long, careful inspection applicable to trees and clouds was not available for the study of lightning.</TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
