<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry Panorama</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Fractals as Art</H1><H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Paint by numbers, or something more?</H2><P><TABLE><TR><TD>Science and art have a complicated relationship.  Can a photograph be art in the same sense that a painting can be art? If you think "No," look at Ansel Adams' <I>Winter Storm</I> picture from his <B>Yosimite Valley</B> protfolio, and consider the question again.</TD></TR><TR><TD>To some extent, fractal geometry - or more precisely, the easy computer generation of intricate fractal images - heightens the tension of this debate.  Yet we are not so convinced there is a problem.  Many uninformed programmers have produced fractal "art" that is just plain ugly.  An early instance of this involved modifying the standard <A HREF="../../../MandelSet/MandelDef/MandelDef.html">Mandelbrot set</A> algorithm to start each iteration with some point other than the critical point z = 0.  The resulting images often looked like Mandelbrot sets that had been run over by heavy trucks; we call these images <I>Mandelbrot roadkill</I>.  In fact, producing interesting images requires not only an aesthetic sense, but also some understanding of the mathematics.  This may be compared with the fact that a painter must have some understanding of the mechanical properties of paint flow.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>To illustrate the way in which fractals blur the boundary between science and art, <A HREF="../../../references/RefPR.html">The Beauty of Fractals</A> is an elaboration of a series of art exhibitions, displayed internationally under the auspices of the Goethe Institute.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>More recently, the March/April 2000 issue of the <I>Ylem</I> newsletter is on "Fractals as Art.  See <A HREF="http://www.ylem.org/">http://www.ylem.org</A>.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Here are some examples of fractal art from a 1999 contest.

To be sure, a subtle hand is required to reliably produce interesting images.  Yet the very parameter dependence opens a new avenue: <FONT COLOR="RED">evolutionary art</FONT>.    <A HREF="GAArt/GAArt.html">Steven Rooke</A> and<A HREF="Sprott/Sprott.html">Julien Sprott</A> have approached this issue in different ways.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Another posibility is to combine the approaches of Sprott and Rooke: in Rooke's genetic algorithm assign fitness by something like Sprott's numerical invariants instead of Rooke's visual inspection.  Of course, aesthetic sense probably cannot be quantified by only a few numbers, and perhaps it is appropriate to leave in the thumbprint of the artist.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>A good example of seeing the artist's ideas in a fractal is this picture by Kerry Mitchell.
