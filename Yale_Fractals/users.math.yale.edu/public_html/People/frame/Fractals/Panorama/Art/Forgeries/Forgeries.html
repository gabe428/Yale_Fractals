With the investment of considerable cleverness by many people, this expectation is fulfilled.</TD></TR><TR><TD>So far, the production of fractal landscapes falls into three eras:</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE><TR><TD>the <A HREF="../MountainsSim/Heroic/Heroic.html">heroic</A> landscapes of Sig Handelman, &nbsp</TD><TD>the <A HREF="../MountainsSim/Classical/Classical.html">classical</A> landscapes of Richard Voss, and &nbsp</TD><TD>the <A HREF="../MountainsSim/Romantic/Romantic.html">romantic</A> landscapes of Ken Musgrave.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>In the very first offering of a fractal geometry course at Yale (spring semester, 1993), Musgrave gave a guest lecture and presented a slide show of his landscape forgeries.  These are some examples.

After Musgrave left, one student asserted a real picture had been included among those that were computer-generated.  Despite contradictory comments by the teacher, several other students spoke up in agreement.  There seemed little hope of convincing them of their error, until it became clear that different students thought different slides were real scenes.  (None were.)  This was one of the most lively discussions in the semester.  The students were genuinely shaken by their inability to distinguish real from artificial.  That these images were made with a modest amount of information (arranged in an exceedingly clever way, to be sure) is among the strongest evidence so far that fractals are a natural language for describing the world around us.</TD></TR><TR><TD>That a cleverly designed fractal approach can give compact encodings of scenes with great natural complexity suggests some aspect of the fractal method does indeed model part of the natural process.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Just getting the picture to look right is not enough, but if the picture can be described by a small data set, we may have discovered an important organizing principle of the subject of the picture.  Yet again, fractals are revealed as a powerful way of organizing our views of the world.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></BODY>
