I generally begin a sculpture by carvingout a space. Like most sculptors, I accidently discovered that a shortcut toforming space was to break a stone and then separate the pieces to form aspace. One then has the natural fractal geometry of the broken stone. BenoitMandelbrot told me "that the word fractal came from fracture, as in the edgeof broken granite, rather then from fraction as some people think."  Thisstatement definitely influenced me since I had been working with brokengranite and was led to a technique for making prints. I begin with a planarshape of one-inch thick polished granite. On the rough side I draw a pattern ofstraight lines along which I tap with a chisel to split the granite along thelines. This results in a fractal division of the planar shape into severalpieces. I separate them to form space between pieces and I may also removesome pieces to form spaces. Black ink is rolled on the polished surface of thestones and a sheet of thin Japanese paper is placed on the inked stones. Whenpressure is applied with a barren, the ink permeates the paper. The lowersurface of the paper on the stones has a solid black image, which was theoriginal intent. It came as a surprise that the ink permeating the paper produced an interesting "grey-black" image on the upper surface that is visiblewhen the print is being made. By applying pressure with a burnishing tool alongthe broken edges, these fractal edges show up as black on the upper surfacedue to the ink permeating the upper surface of the paper. Thus one actuallyobtains a two-sided print, where the lower side is black and the upper sideis a grey-black monoprint controlled by the pressure of the barren and theburnishing tool.  One can also fold one side onto the other to obtain an imagecombining both sides. One can also use colored inks, which has opened upmany more possibilities.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>Here are four prints, a sculpture, and a picture of a sculpture and two prints made from it.

I have control over the pattern of straight lines that I draw on the back of the stone along which I tap with a chisel to break the stone. However, I have no control over the way the stone breaks to form natural fractals, which introduces a certain randomness. In a print such as <I>River and Streams</I>, I call attention to the fact that the fractal geometry of broken granite and the fractal geometry of rivers and streams is the same. In the print the river is represented by the wider spacing of the stones and the streams correspond to the narrow spacing. Part of the process is selecting appropriate spacings. In some prints I just like working with the natural fractal geometry for its own sake without any underlying meaning.<BR>I have also made some abstract fractal torsos that are done by breaking a stone, removing some inner pieces, and then reassembling the remaining pieces. Here the fractal geometry reflects the psychological process of coming apart and putting yourself back together. The inner space may have a positive or negative interpretation. It could represent getting rid of something that bothered you or it could represent the loss of someone. In any case, only fractal geometry can convey this psychological process of breaking apart. Here is where fractal geometry reflects nature in psychology.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
