<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry Panorama</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Hollywood Needs Fractals</H1><P><TABLE><TR><TD>As recounted in the Foreword of <A HREF="../../../references/RefTSOFI.html">The Science of Fractal Images</A>, Loren Carpenter engineered the fractal planet sequences in <I>Star Trek II</I>.  Extensive fractal landscapes also were included in <I>The Last Starfighter</I>.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>More recently, Ken Musgrave has used fractals and multifractals to generate scenes for <I>Apollo 13</I>, <I>Dante's Peak</I>, and <I>Titanic</I>.  For example,</TD></TR> <TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Apollo13.html" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=400></TD></TR><TR><TD>Here is another example from the November, 2000 issue of <I>Scientific American</I>.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD><TABLE BORDER BGCOLOR="FFFBC6"><TR><TD>"The ferocious seas engulfing actor Mark Wahlberg in <I>The Perfect Storm</I> were simulated by Industrial Light & Magic using computational fluid dynamics for waves and turbulence; rule-based particle dynamics for ripples, foam and spray; and fractal-based shaders that add surface textures and even scatter light inside water drops."</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>In addition, fractals and chaos have been a subject in film and television.  For example, in an episode of <I>Murphy Brown</I>, Buck Henry played the inventor of fractal geometry, and gave some accurate technical descriptions.  The Mandelbrot set appeared in an episode of the <I>X-Files</I>.  The <A HREF="../../../Chaos/ChaosDef/ChaosDefSDI.html">sensitivity of initial conditions</A> of chaos is wonderfully represented by the "Time and Punishment" episode of <I>The Simpsons</I>, demonstrated by Jeff Goldblum rolling drops of water off Laura Dern's hand in <I>Jurassic Park</I>, and in all of the film <I>Sliding Doors</I>.</TD></TR></TABLE></P>  </BODY>
