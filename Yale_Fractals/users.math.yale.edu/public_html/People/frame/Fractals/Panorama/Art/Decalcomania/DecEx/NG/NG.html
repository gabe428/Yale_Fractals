In these explosions, the fractal patterns contract inward, but also seem to burst outward."</UL></TD></TR><TR><TD>This plate, "revealed a divison between visual art and fractals by posing a question of aesthetics, objectivity and subjectivity."</TD></TR>  <TR><TD><UL>"On the one hand, this plate remains objective in that it is governed by fractal structures.  The process is not one created by the artist's hand, but rather, by nature.  Yet it was important to me, as an artist, to recognize my role in the creative process and reference my hand in the work.  I wanted to both recognize the natural beauty of fractal patterns and maintain my subjectivity and control as an artist."</UL></TD></TR><TR><TD>"With the prints, I took the artistic process and my subjectivity a step further.  I used my aesthetic judgements to try and create an emotional response.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>"This is particularly successful in some of the more subtle prints in which the relationship between the figure and ground in the fractal forms becomes blurred.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>"The spaces between the fractals become part of the object even though the spaces do not contain points in the given fractal.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>"In many places, the ground and the object flip back and forth in space, so that the image functions on multiple levels.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>"Many of the fractals do not seem to exist only on a flat plane, but within space, as a sort of landscape.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>"The self-similarity of the fractals pulls the viewer into the image, leading the eye down various pathways and turns in the pattern.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>"It is the explosions, in particular, that create spaces for the viewer to linger upon, before venturing out into the intricate network of pattern."</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="../DecEx.html">Decalcomania examples</A>.</P></BODY>
