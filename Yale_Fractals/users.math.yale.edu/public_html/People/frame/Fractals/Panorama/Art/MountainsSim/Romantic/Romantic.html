Combining programming skill and a good eye for landscapes, he has produced some of the most convincing fractal landscape pictures.  The right image is an example.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>The simplest terrain pictures are built without thinking of the underlying natural mechanisms, but rather just reproduce the visible landscape characteristics.  These are called <FONT COLOR="RED">ontogenetic</FONT> models; many are based on <A HREF="../../../../RandFrac/fBm/fBM-2.html">fractional Brownian motion</A> (fBm).</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>While this may be fine for small patches of terrain, fBm suffers from having a statistically uniform roughness.  That is, all parts of the picture have the same dimension.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Large-range landscapes are more varied: the tops of mountains usually are rougher than the floors of valleys, and  mountains are scattered throughout foothills and plains.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>A  single dimension will not characterize this variety of landscape types, so large-range pictures are must be synthesized with multifractals.  The image below is an example of a multifractal surface patch.</TD></TR> </TABLE></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="KM1.gif" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=266></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" COLSPAN=2><IMG SRC="MultiFracPatch.gif" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=160></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>In addition to a terrain function, four other considerations are important for generating realistic landscapes.  These are atmopsheric effects, textures, level of detail, and practical methodology (whatever it takes to make the simulation work).</TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>For example, atmospheric perspective introduces a sense of scale by the blurring and loss of contrast of distant objects viewed through the atmosphere.  The scattering that produces these effects is complex, but efficient ontogenetic approximations can be incorporated into the code.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>The left picture below does not use atmospheric perspective, and looks very much like a scene from an old movie.  We expect to see a guy in a Godzilla suit rise up from the water.</TD></TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>The right does use atmospheric perspective.
