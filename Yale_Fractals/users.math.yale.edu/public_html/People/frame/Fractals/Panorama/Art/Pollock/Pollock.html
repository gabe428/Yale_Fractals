One straight section of the broken line corresponds to r in the range 1mm < r < 5cm, the other straight section to 5cm < r < 2.5 m.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>The lower range is determined by how the paint drips onto the canvas, the upper range by how Pollock moved across the canvas.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Early drip paintings done in 1943 had upper range slopes (the box-counting dimension of the pattern) close to 1.  By 1952, this slope had increased to about 1.7.  The increase in dimension appears to correlate well with the evolution of Pollock's paint dripping technique.</TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
