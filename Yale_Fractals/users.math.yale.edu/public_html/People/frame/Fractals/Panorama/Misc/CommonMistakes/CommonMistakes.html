The more levels of the pattern, the more convincing the fractality of the picture.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Here is an analogous example based on the <A HREF="TetraEx.html">Sierpinski tetrahedron</A>.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="TwoHands.gif" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=95></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>Second, <FONT COLOR = "RED">a repeating pattern alone is not sufficient to guarantee fractality</FONT>.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>A checkerboard or a brick wall has a repeating pattern, but the repetition is with respect to translation, whereas for fractals the appropriate transformation is magnification.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD>  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="BrickWall.gif" WIDTH=153 HEIGHT=80></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>Third, <FONT COLOR = "RED">repeating a pattern under magnification is not sufficient to guarantee fractality</FONT>.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>For example, a spiral (<B>A</B> below) is symmetric under magnification about its center point, but about no other point.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Iterating this process, the limiting shape is just a single point.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>In order to produce a fractal, at each level the decomposition must involve at least two scaled copies.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Nested dolls (often Russian, but not in this instance, <B>B</B>) are another example of a non-fractal involving a single scaling transformation, as is the cat bottle (<B>C</B>).</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>On the other hand, the cow picture (<B>D</B>) is fractal, as would be more obvious if the cow's left earring were turned toward us.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Thanks to Nial Neger for finding the cat and cow pictures.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Click on all but the spiral to magnfy in a new window.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE ALIGN="CENTER"><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>A</B></TD>   <TD><IMG SRC="Spiral.gif" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=102></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>B</B></TD>  <TD><A HREF="javascript:location='CommonMistakes.html';window.open('Frogs.html','Frogs','WIDTH=750,HEIGHT=550,scrollbar=yes')"><IMG SRC="FrogsS.gif" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=200></A></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>C</B></TD>   <TD><A HREF="javascript:location='CommonMistakes.html';window.open('cat.html','cat','WIDTH=750,HEIGHT=550,scrollbar=yes')"><IMG SRC="catS.gif" WIDTH=136 HEIGHT=200></A></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>D</B></TD><TD><A HREF="javascript:location='CommonMistakes.html';window.open('cow.html','cow','WIDTH=800,HEIGHT=550,scrollbar=yes')"><IMG SRC="cowS.gif" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=200></A></TD></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
