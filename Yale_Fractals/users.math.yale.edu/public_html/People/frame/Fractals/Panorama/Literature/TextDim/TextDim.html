<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry Panorama</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Dimensions of Texts</H1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The late physicist James Corbett proposed, perhaps not entirely seriously, a method of quantifying the complexity of texts.  Diagram the sentences of the text, and string the diagrams together one after the other, forming a "text diagram."  Put a unit mass at the location of each word, and starting from the center of the text diagram, compute M(r), the mass of words within a circle of radius r from the center.  If the complexity of the text obeys a <A HREF="../../../FracAndDim/BoxDim/PowerLaw/PowerLaw.html">power-law scaling</A>, a signature of a fractal structure, then <P ALIGN="CENTER">M(r) = k*r<SUP>d</SUP>  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Plotting log(M(r)) versus log(r), power-law dependence reveals itself by the data points falling along a line.  The slope of the line is the <A HREF="../../../FracAndDim/OtherDims/OtherDims.html">dimension<A> d of the text.  For intermediate-length texts, Corbett found reasonable agreement with a power-law fit.  Moreover, the simpler the text, the lower the dimension.  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because much of the structure of a text depends on grammatical restrictions, finding no power-law dependence would not have been surprising.  What can we deduce from the presence of this sclaing?<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Corbett's dimension of diagramed sentence as a measure of linguistic complexity.<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></BODY>
