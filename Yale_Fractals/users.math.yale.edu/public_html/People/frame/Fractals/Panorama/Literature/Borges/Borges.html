The Aleph's diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished.  Each thing was infinite things, since I distinctly saw it from every angle of the universe.  I saw the teeming sea; I saw daybreak and nightfall; I saw the multitudes of America; I saw a silvery cobweb in the center of a black pyramid;" and on and on, until "I saw the Aleph from every point and angle, and in the Aleph I saw the Earth and in the earth the Aleph and in the Aleph the earth.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>Borges' Aleph suggests <A HREF="../../Philosophy/Leibnitz/Leibnitz.html">Leibnitz</A>'s monads: each part of the universe contains the entire universe, hence infinitely many copies of the universe, each of which contains infinitely many copies of the uiverse, and so on.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Although he did not phrase it this way, Leibnitz devised a fractal model of the universe, and Borges' Aleph is a realization of a Leibnitzian monad.</TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
