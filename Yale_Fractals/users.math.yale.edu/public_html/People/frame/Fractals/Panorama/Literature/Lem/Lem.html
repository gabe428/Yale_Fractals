Although the individual elements are too simple to respond effectively to environmental stresses, the cloud, a product of inorganic evolution, can respond with terrifying power and sophistication.  The cloud is a physical relaization of a 3-dimensional <A HREF="../../../CA/welcome.html">cellular automaton</A>.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Here is a brief quote, indicating the care with which he treates the issues od self-organization.</TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER BGCOLOR="FFFBC6">"Are you suggesting that these elements have been clever enough to jump back to their proper places again by themselves?  That would imply some initial blueprint of the entire brain - ""Not necessarily.  It suffices for each element to recall those elements with which it was in immediate contact." ... "But this is no more than a grossly simplified description.  The process must be far more complicated than that - just consider how frequently these individual elements are destroyed - and yet the overall functioning of the superstructure remains unaffected."</TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>Other of Lem's stories deal with artifical worlds, cyberspace landscapes inhabited by virtual creatures.  We wonder if Lem imagined fractal constructions to make natural-looking artificial landscapes, or to provide easy navigation for the inhabitants of these worlds.</TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
