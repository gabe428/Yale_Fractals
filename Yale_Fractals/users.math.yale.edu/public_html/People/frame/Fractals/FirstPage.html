Introduction to Fractals and IFS</A> is an introduction to some basic geometry of fractal sets, with emphasis on the Iterated Function System (IFS) formalism for generating fractals.  In addition, we explore the application of IFS to detect patterns, and also several examples of architectural fractals.</TD></TR><TR><TD><A HREF="FracAndDim/welcome.html" TARGET="welcome">2. Natural Fractals and Dimensions</A> presents a method of measuring the complexity of fractals.  Generalizing the familiar notion of Euclidean dimension, fractal dimension can be computed from experimental data.  These computations have design consequences in such areas as antennas and fiber optics.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD><A HREF="MandelSet/welcome.html" TARGET="welcome">3. The Mandelbrot Set and Julia Sets</A> is remarkable deconstruction of the notions of simplicity and complexity: a single quadratic equation contains infinitely detailed worlds of baroque splendor that pose mathematical questions unanswered even today.  Yet the algorithm to generate these pictures can be understood by anyone familiar with basic arithmetic.</TD></TR>   <TR><TD><A HREF="CA/welcome.html" TARGET="welcome">4. Cellular Automata and Fractal Evolution</A>, or how to build a world in a computer.  These simple worlds can generate fractals, and exhibit wonderfully complicated dynamics.  The biological paradigm can be extended to evolve populations of computer programs, and we are led, perhaps, to fractal aspects of evolution.</TD></TR> <TR><TD><A HREF="RandFrac/welcome.html" TARGET="welcome">5. Random Fractals and the Stock Market</A> extends the geometrical fractals studied so far to fractals involving some elements of randomness.  After examples from biology, physics, and astronomy, we apply these ideas to the stock market.  Do we uncover useful information?  Wait and see.</TD></TR> <TR><TD><A HREF="Chaos/welcome.html" TARGET="welcome">6. Chaos</A> is type of dynamical behavior most commonly characterized by sensitivity to initial conditions: tiny changes can grow to huge effects.  Inevitible uncertainties in our knowledge of the initial conditions grow to overwhelm long-term prediction.  Yet we shall see chaos has engineering and medical applications.</TD></TR> <TR><TD><A HREF="MultiFractals/welcome.html" TARGET="welcome">7. Multifractals</A> generalizes the notion of fractals as objects to fractals as measures.  We can examine the distribution of resources in a region, compute the dimension of the parts with the same amount, and plot dimension as a function of amount.  This gives a single picture embracing the entire range of complexity.</TD></TR>    <TR><TD><A HREF="FracTrees/welcome.html" TARGET="welcome">8. Fractal Trees</A> is a short analysis of dimensions of several aspects of mathematical (not realistic) fractal trees.  Yet even this simple problem has some surprises.</TD></TR>    <TR><TD><A HREF="CircInvFrac/welcome.html" TARGET="welcome">9. Circle Inversions</A> is Iterated Function Systems when the affine transformations are replaced by inversions in circles.  The loss of IFS linearity gives rise to new families of pictures, and to new mathematical problems.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD><A HREF="Panorama/welcome.html" TARGET="welcome">10.
