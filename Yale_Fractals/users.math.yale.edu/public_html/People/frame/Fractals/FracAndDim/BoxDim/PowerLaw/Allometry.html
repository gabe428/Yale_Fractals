Indeed, this is observed, familiar even.  A mouse's heart beats very rapidly, a whale's heart very slowly.  Add in the observation that most mammal hearts beat 1 to 2 billion times during the animal's life and we understand that in the absence of external perturbation (early death due to predation or disease, for example), a mouse has a shorter life than a person, who in turn has a shorter life than a whale.</TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp</TD></TR><TR><TD>This makes perfect sense, but careful measurements by Kleiber in 1932 revealed something different: for most animals, over a range of sizes spanning 21 orders of magnitude, the metabolic rate per unit mass varies as M<SUP>-1/4</SUP> rather than as M<SUP>-1/3</SUP>.</TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp</TD></TR><TR><TD>Adding to the interest of this question, plants exhibit this M<SUP>-1/4</SUP> metabolic scaling law.  Also, other biological variables exhibit power law scalings with mass.  Life-span scales as M<SUP>1/4</SUP>, age of first reproduction as M<SUP>3/4</SUP>, the time of embryonic development as M<SUP>-1/4</SUP>, and the diameters of tree trunks and of aortas as M<SUP>3/8</SUP>, for example.</TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp</TD></TR><TR><TD>The reason for the observed M<SUP>-1/4</SUP> scaling is not understood, but several explanations have been proposed.  One is based on the observation that the diffusion does not occur across a smooth 2-dimensional surface, but across the fractal boundary of the lungs.  Because the dimension of the lungs is <NOBR>d > 2</NOBR>, the metabolic rate scales as L<SUP>d</SUP>, so as M<SUP>d/3</SUP>.  Then the metabolic rate per unit mass scales as M<SUP>d/3 - 1</SUP>.  Because <NOBR>d > 2,</NOBR> <NOBR>d/3 - 1 > -1/3.</NOBR>  Measurements of the dimension of the lungs suggest a metabolic rate/unit mass of about -1/4.</TD></TR></TABLE></P>  <P>Return to <A HREF="PowerLaw.html">Power Laws</A>.</P></BODY>
