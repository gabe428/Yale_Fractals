Five levels of box sizes gives an overall side length reduction by a factor of 16, hardly more than one decade of data, so this example is meant only to illustrate the process and should not be taken as a serious demonstration of fractality.  Typically, at least two decades (the smallest boxes have side length 1/100 that of the largest boxes) are required for a plausible claim of fractality.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Pictured here are the largest and smallest boxes.  Certainly, smaller boxes pick up more detail than larger.  The dimension measures this increase, under the assumption - validated if in a log-log plot the data points lie nearly on a straight line - that this increase is according to a power law.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="DeerSutureBoxes.gif" WIDTH=604 HEIGHT=527></TD></TR><TR><TD>The points do appear to lie close to a straight line.
