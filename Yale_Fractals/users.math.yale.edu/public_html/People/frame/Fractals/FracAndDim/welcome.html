Natural Fractals and Dimensions</H1><P>Pictured below are the <A HREF="../IntroToFrac/InitGen/InitGenKoch.html">Koch curve</A> and three of its <A HREF="KochThckn.gif" Target="BLANK">relatives</A>.  From top left to bottom right, these pictures become increasingly "fuzzy."  Can we find a way to quantify the difference in these pictures?  Perhaps such a method could be used to distinguish the coastline of Norway from that of Italy, for example, or the beating of a healthy heart from that of a diseased heart, or the closing prices of a conservative stock from those of a more risky stock, or a text of Shakespeare from one of Bacon.
