Here we see a family of fractals, starting with a straight line (<NOBR>N = 4</NOBR> pieces, each scaled by </NOBR>r = 1/4</NOBR>), of dimension 1, and ending with a filled-in triangle (<NOBR>N = 4</NOBR> pieces, each scaled by </NOBR>r = 1/2</NOBR>), of dimension 2.  In this family of fractals, we keep <NOBR>N = 4</NOBR>, and step r from 0.25 to 0.5 in increments of 0.025.  As their dimension increases, the Koch curve relatives come closer to filling in a solid region of the plane</TD></TR>  <TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="KochMovie2.html"><IMG SRC="pa.gif" WIDTH=287 HEIGHT=158></A></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">Click the picture to animate.</TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
