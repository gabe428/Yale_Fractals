Values for r, s, e, and f are input as positive ornegative decimals. Values for theta are input as positive ornegative angles in degrees. If a value is zero, it can be left blank.  All blank inputs are treated as zero values.  The probabilities are decimals that sum to 1.  <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">Enter the number of transformations you are using in the box of that name.</FONT>  Click on Run to see thegraph. To get subsequent graphs, clear all values you will not be using, enter new values where needed and click on Run.</P></BODY>
