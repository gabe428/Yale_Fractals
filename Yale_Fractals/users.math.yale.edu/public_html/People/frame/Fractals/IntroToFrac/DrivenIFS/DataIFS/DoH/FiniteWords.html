We can estimate the probability of each of the 16 pairs by counting the number of points in the corresponding subsquare and dividing by 4096.  The number of points in each address through length 2 can be obtained from the <I>Address Stats</I> menu of the <A HREF="../../../../Software/drivenifs-2.html">driven IFS program</A>.  In this way, we obtain these nonzero populations</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE><TR><TD>n<SUB>1</SUB>=1021, n<SUB>2</SUB>=637, n<SUB>3</SUB>=889, n<SUB>4</SUB>=1549</TD></TR> <TR><TD>n<SUB>11</SUB>=209, n<SUB>14</SUB>=812, n<SUB>21</SUB>=259, n<SUB>24</SUB>=377, n<SUB>31</SUB>=476, n<SUB>33</SUB>=53, n<SUB>34</SUB>=360, n<SUB>41</SUB>=77, n<SUB>42</SUB>=637, n<SUB>43</SUB>=835</TD></TR> </TABLE></TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Note the address 241 is empty, but both 24 and 41 are occupied.  That is, this length 3 address is not empty as a consequence of forbidden pairs.

That is, we are testing the hypothesis that all addresses that remain empty for long time series must contain one of the forbidden pairs 12, 13, 22, 23, 32, 44.  If we find it unlikely that address 241 would be visited in 4096 iterations, then we deduce that 241 probably is a forbidden triple not a consequence of any forbidden pair.<TR><TD>For this calculation, we build a simple Markov process with five states A, B, C, D, and E:</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>A </TD><TD>241 has not occurred, and the current string has left-most entry 2 or 3,</TD></TR><TR><TD>B </TD><TD>241 has not occurred, and the current string has left-most entry 1,</TD></TR><TR><TD>C </TD><TD>241 has not occurred, the current string has left-most entry 4, and the previous entry is not 1</TD></TR><TR><TD>D </TD><TD>241 has not occurred, the current string has left-most entry 4, and the previous entry is 1</TD></TR><TR><TD>E </TD><TD>241 has occurred</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>The transitions between the states of the Markov process are shown in this graph.</TD></TR> <TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="MarkovGraph.gif" WIDTH=520 HEIGHT=317></TD></TR><TR><TD>How are we to understand this graph?</TD></TR> <TR><TD><B>A &#8594; B</B> To move from A to B we must apply T<SUB>1</SUB>.
