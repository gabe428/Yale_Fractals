So a relatively large number of points in the 14 square means a large fall often was followed by a large rise.  The near emptiness of the 41 subsquare means large gains were only rarely followed by large losses.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="Wu.html">Driven IFS and the Taiwanese and Chinese Stock Markets</A>.</P></BODY>
