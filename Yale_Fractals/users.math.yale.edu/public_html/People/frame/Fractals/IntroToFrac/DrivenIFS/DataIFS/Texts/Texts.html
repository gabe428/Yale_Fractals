How can we convert this into a string in an alphabet of four symbols?</TD></TR>  <TR><TD><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>One possibility is to treat words as the fundamental units of the text, and assign bins by <A HREF="POS/POS.html">parts of speech</A>.  This has an obvious problem: distinguishing how much of the driven IFS structure is due to the author's style, and how much to grammatical constraints.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Another choice is to treat <A HREF="Alphabet/Alphabet.html">letters as the fundamental units</A> and assign bins by ignoring some letters, or grouping the letters together.  Of course, any choices must be justified in a way reflecting properties of the text.  This is not an easy problem.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Finding a meaningful translation of text into a symbol string suitable for driving an IFS is an intricate problem.  But this is a very good feature of the driven IFS approach: it encourages experimentation with different methods, thought about open-ended problems, questions for which there are no right answers.  In addition, it can lead to good mathematical questions about the driven IFS itself. </TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR>     <TR><TD>Here are four examples of recent student projects.</TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>Investigating the authorship of chapters of <A HREF="Genesis/Genesis.html">Genesis</A> using gemantria to convert text to numbers.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Comparing the sound patterns of  <A HREF="Clark/Clark.html">sonnets</A> using the soundex algorithm to convert text to numbers.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Olaf Schneider's analysis of shot duration and distance in <A HREF="../Schneider/Schneider1.html">film</A>.</TD></TR><TR><TD><A HREF="Runde/Runde.html">Phonological analysis</A> of English texts.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="../DataIFS.html">Data-Driven IFS</A>.</P> </BODY>
