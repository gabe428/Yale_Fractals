How could you interpret this?</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>* The points on the diagonal in subsquare 12 (and their absence on the diagonal in subsquare 13) shows that long strings of differences in bins 2 and 3 that end in bin 2 can be followed by a difference in bin 1, while those strings of 2 and 3 ending in 3 are only rarely followed by a difference in bin 1.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>That we are dealing with only a finite data set (a bit over 1000 points here) has an important consequence:</TD></TR>   <TR><TD>* If a subsquare is empty, does this reflect a true causal exclusion, or is it simply a result of the shortness of the data set?</TD></TR>   <TR><TD>If we had more points, would some land in this empty subsquare?</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>There are <A HREF="../../DoH/FiniteWords.html">ways to estimate this</A>, but the basic observation is that the smaller the empty subsquare (hence the longer the putatively excluded string), the less sure we are it would remain empty if we got more data.</TD></TR> </TABLE></P>    <P>Return to <A HREF="EMC.html">EMC data</A>.</P></BODY>
