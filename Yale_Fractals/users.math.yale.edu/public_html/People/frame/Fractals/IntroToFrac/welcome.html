Introduction to Fractals</H1><P><TABLE><TR><TD>Here we introduce some basic geometry of fractals, with emphasis on the Iterated Function System (IFS) formalism for generating fractals.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>In addition, we explore the application of IFS to detect patterns, and also several examples of architectural fractals.</TD></TR><TR><TD>First, though, we review <A HREF="SelfSim/Symmetry/Symmetry.html">familiar symmetries</A> of nature, preparing us for the new kind of symmetry that fractals exhibit.</TD></TR></P><P><TABLE BORDER><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>A</B>. The geometric characterization of the simplest fractals is <A HREF="SelfSim/SelfSim.html">self-similarity</A>: the shape is made of smaller copies of itself.  The copies are similar to the whole: same shape but different size.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="SelfSim/gasketS.gif" WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=64></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>B</B>. <A HREF="SelfSimEx/SelfSimExS.html">More examples of self-similarity</A> examples, and variations including nonlinear self-similarity, self-affinity, and statistical self-similarity.
