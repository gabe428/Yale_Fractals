Using the self-similarity (or self-affinity) of F, decompose F as F = F<SUB>1</SUB> &#8746; ... &#8746; F<SUB>n</SUB>, where each F<SUB>i</SUB> is a scaled copy of F.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Because the transformations can involve rotations, reflections, and scalings by different factors in different directions, decomposition is not always as simple a task as it may seem at first.  Here are some <A HREF="Decomp/DecompEx1.html">examples</A> of more complicated decompositions.</TD></TR><TR><TD>An additional problem is that decompositions never are unique.  Here are some <A HREF="Decomp/DecompEx2.html">examples</A> of different decompositions of the same fractal.</TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp</TD></TR><TR><TD>2. For each piece F<SUB>i</SUB>, find an affine transformationT<SUB>i</SUB> for which T<SUB>i</SUB>(F) = F<SUB>i</SUB>.
