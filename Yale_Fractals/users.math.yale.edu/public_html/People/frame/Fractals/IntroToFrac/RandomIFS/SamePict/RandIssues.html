Using a random number generator is not the most efficient way to visit all regions of address length N.  With some cleverness, specific orderings can be constructed to visit all regions more quickly.</P><P>2.  Even in the limit of infinitely many applications, the Random Algorithm generates only countalbly many points, whereas the Determinisitc Algorithm typically produces an uncountable point set.  For these methods to produce the same picture, we must modify the Random Algorithm by defining the set it produces to be the closure of the countable set.</P> <P>3.  For IFS with nonlinear transformations (e.g., Julia sets, circle inversion limit sets) the contraction factor varies with location, so under the Random Algorithm some regions may fill in very slowly indeed.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="SamePict.html">Same Picture</A>.</P></BODY>
