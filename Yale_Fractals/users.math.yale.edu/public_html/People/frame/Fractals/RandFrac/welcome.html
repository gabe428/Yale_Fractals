Practically every example observed involves what appears to be some element of randomness, perhaps due to the interactions of very many small parts of the process.  Think of the complicated interaction of hydrodynamical and geological forces scuplting a fractal coastline, or of the thousands of economic agents driving the stock market.  Here we invstrigate random fractals, look at various statistical properties they possess, note how they appear in a huge variety of settings (from bacteria colonies to clusters of galaxies), and investigate a new family of very simple random cartoons that can be fine-tuned to exhibit a variety of statistical properties.</P><P>Some useful ideas from basic probability: <A HREF="ExpectedValue/ExpectedValue.html">expected value</A>,<A HREF="StandardDeviation/StandardDeviation.html">standard deviation</A>, and <A HREF="NormalDist/NormalDist.html">normal distribution</A>.</P><P><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="SelfSimDistr/SelfSimDistr.html">Self-Similar Distributions</A> A simple way to add some randomness to fractal constructions.</TD> <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="SelfSimDistr/SelfSimDistrS.gif" WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=63></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="StatSelfSim/StatSelfSim.html">Statistical Self-Similarity</A> Another way to add some randomness to fractal constructions.</TD> <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="StatSelfSim/StatSelfSimS.gif" WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=63></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="Brownian/Brownian.html">Brownian Motion</A> The dance of pollen grains in a water drop, observed by Robert Brown in 1827 and explained by Albert Einstein in 1905 as the effect of individual water molecules hitting the pollen.
