Feature (i) results from the preponderance of data points lying in bin<SUB>1</SUB> and bin<SUB>4</SUB>.  Moreover, to the limit of our vision, data points land in these bins in all combinations.  Feature (ii) is the result of data points in bin<SUB>1</SUB> and bin<SUB>4</SUB> being followed occasionally by data points in bin<SUB>2</SUB> and in bin<SUB>3</SUB>.
