Then we know N(r) and r.  Can we find d, the dimension of the object?  We have to solve the equation <NOBR>N(r) = (1/r)<SUP>d</SUP></NOBR> for d.  This is an exponential equation and we are trying to find the exponent.  To solve an equation for one of its variables, we need to do the inverse operations in the reverse order.  The inverse of exponentiation is done using logarithms.  So we should start to solve for d by taking the log of both sides of the equation.  We can use any base for the log we want, as long as it is the same on both sides of the equation.</NOBR></TD></TR><TR><TD>20.  Start with N(r) = (1/r)<SUP>d</SUP> and write the equation you get by taking the log of both sides.</TD></TR><TR><TD>21.  Use the log property of exponents to simplify the right side of the equation you just wrote.  Write this simplified equation.</TD></TR><TR><TD>22.  Solve this simplified equation for d.</TD></TR><TR><TD>This is the equation we are seeking.  It finds the dimension of an object by using logarithms.  It is important to note that to use this equation, the original object must contain similar scaled copies of itself.  For this reason this dimension is known as the similarity dimension.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="LogAndDIm-2.html">Dimensions and Logarithms</A>.</P></BODY>
