<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Addresses on an Inch Scale Ruler</H2><P><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Consider an inch.  We shall successively subdivide it into halves, and the halves into halves, and so on.  Seeking the scaled patterns within patterns is a natural approach for people accustomed to thinking about fractals.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="BinP1.gif" WIDTH=353 HEIGHT=80></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">First, divide the inch into halves, left and right.  To each point in this inch we assign an <I>address</I>, 0 to the points on the left half, 1 to the points on the right half.  Because an address of 0 means the point is less than <NOBR>1/2</NOBR> and an address of 1 means the point is greater than <NOBR>1/2</NOBR>, we can think of this address as giving the number of <NOBR>1/2s</NOBR> in the point.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="BinP2.gif" WIDTH=353 HEIGHT=80></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Next divide each half into halves of halves, that is, into quarters.  The second address digit, 0 or 1, indicates whether the point is in the left or right side of the half to which it belongs.  From left to right, the addresses of the quarters are 00, 01, 10, and 11.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="BinP3.gif" WIDTH=353 HEIGHT=80></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Now divide the quarters into eighths.  The addresses are 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="BinP4.gif" WIDTH=353 HEIGHT=80></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Divide the eighths into sixteenths.  The addresses are 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1111.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="BinP5.gif" WIDTH=353 HEIGHT=80></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Note the <I>order of the address digits</I>.  The first (left) digit tells us to which half of the inch the point belongs, the next digit to which half of that half, and so on. How can we compare this with the <A HREF="AddrOrder.html">usual order</A> we write addresses on mail.</TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>To strengthen the tie to fractals, we show addresses can be interpreted in terms of  <A HREF="AddrFcns.html">functions</A>, and the order of the address digits is identical to the order of the composition of these functions.</TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
