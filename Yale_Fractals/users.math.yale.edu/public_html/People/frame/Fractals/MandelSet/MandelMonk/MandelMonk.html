<HEAD> 	 <TITLE>THE MANDELBROT MONK</TITLE>   </HEAD>   <BODY BGCOLOR="#FF9999">  	 <TABLE WIDTH="75%" BGCOLOR="#FF9999" CELLPADDING="20" CELLSPACING="0"> 		<TR> 		  <TD> 			 <H2 ALIGN="left">THE MANDELBROT MONK</H2> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>by Ray Girvan</B></FONT></P> 			 <P> <FONT SIZE="2">				<IMG SRC="udomand.gif" ALT="Mandelbrot set: modern image" ALIGN="RIGHT"				 WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="225" BORDER="0"><B> Until recently, Udo of Aachen occupied				a sideline in the history books as a minor poet, copyist and theological				essayist. Even his birth and death dates of this mediaeval Benedictine monk are				unknown, though he probably lived from around 1200-1270 AD. [*1] A new study of				his work, however, has led to his recognition as an outstandingly original and				talented mathematician.</B></FONT></P> 			 <P> <FONT SIZE="2"> While Udo himself is little-known, one of his				works is far more familiar. This 13th century German monk was the author of a				poem called <EM>Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi</EM> (<EM>Luck, Empress of the				World</EM>) in the collection of mediaeval underground verses now known as the				<EM>Carmina Burana</EM>. [*2] Orchestrated by composer Carl Orff in 1937, Udo's				poem is now widespread as the choral work, <EM>O Fortuna</EM>, which has been				used by the media many times, from incidental music to the film				<EM>Excalibur</EM> to the backing for after-shave lotion				advertisements.</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> The first clue to Udo's undiscovered skills was				found by mathematician Bob Schipke, a retired professor of combinatorics. On a				holiday visit to Aachen cathedral, the burial place of Charlemagne, Schipke saw				something that amazed him. In a tiny nativity scene illuminating the manuscript				of a 13th century carol, <EM>O froehliche Weihnacht</EM>, he noticed that the				Star of Bethlehem looked odd. On examining it in detail, he saw that the gilded				image seemed to be a representation of the Mandelbrot set, one of the icons of				the computer age. [*3]</FONT></P> 			 <P> <FONT SIZE="-1"><IMG SRC="nativit.jpg" ALIGN="left" WIDTH="250"				HEIGHT="272" ALT="O froehliche Weihnacht"> Discovered in 1976 by IBM researcher				Benoit Mandelbrot, the Mandelbrot set is the most famous fractal (a				mathematical object with the property of infinite detail). Only the advent of				fast computers made feasible the repeated calculations involved - or so it was				thought. [*4]</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> "I was stunned," Schipke says. "It was like				finding a picture of Bill Gates in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The colophon [the				title page] named the copyist as Udo of Aachen, and I just had to find out more				about this guy."</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> Schipke visited Bavaria, where the poems,				<EM>Cantiones profanae</EM> (now the <EM>Carmina Burana</EM>), were discovered				in 1837. Written by wandering scholars and monks in the 13th century, they were				collected as an anthology in the Benedictine monastery at Beuron, near Munich,				and Schipke began his search there. With the help of historian Dr Antje				Eberhardt at the University of Munich, Schipke gained access to ecclesiastical				archives, where he found a document called the Codex Udolphus. Written in				illuminated Latin, with informal marginalia in Greek, the Codex bore the				signature of Udo himself.</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> "Although it had been discovered in the 19th				century, it had promptly been filed away again," Schipke says. "The local				historian who found it was clearly no mathematician, and dismissed it as				obscure theology. But it yielded several major surprises."</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> In a recent paper, Schipke and Eberhardt report				on Udo's discoveries. [*5] The first chapter, <EM>Astragali</EM>				(<EM>Dice</EM>) was originally thought to be a discourse on the evils of				gambling. It turned out to be Udo's research into what we now would call				probability theory. He derived simple rules to add and multiply probabilities,				and thus devised strategies for several card and dice games.</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> The second part, <EM>Fortuna et Orbis</EM>				(<EM>Luck and a Circle</EM>) describes Udo's determination of the value of pi				by scattering equal sticks on a ruled surface, and counting what proportion lie				across the lines. This was an anticipation of the Buffon's Needle technique,				named after the 18th century mathematician normally credited with its				discovery. [*6] This is a very laborious method, but Udo managed to get a				respectable - but very lucky - approximation of 866/275 (3.1418...) and had				enough confidence in it to dispute the value of pi=3 implied in the Bible. [*7]				(I say 'lucky' because Buffon's Method converges extremely badly, and it's well				possible that Udo achieved this good result by choosing his stopping point				judiciously - perhaps influenced by the 3.1418 quoted by his contemporary,				Leonard of Pisa, otherwise known as Fibonacci).</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> Schipke continues: "What was interesting at this				point was that we looked back at the words of <EM>O Fortuna</EM>, and suddenly				they fell into place. Verse two - <EM> Luck / like the moon / changeable in				state / We are cast down / like straws upon a ploughed field / Our fates				measuring / the eternal circle</EM> - is very clearly an allusion to the				Buffon's Needle method." [*8]</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> More was to come. In the final and longest				chapter, <EM>Salus</EM> (<EM>Salvation</EM>), Schipke uncovered the most				radical work. Udo had, it seemed, investigated the Mandelbrot set, seven				centuries before Mandelbrot.</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1">				<IMG SRC="udomag.jpg" ALIGN="left" WIDTH="361" HEIGHT="361"				 ALT="O froehliche Weihnacht (detail)"> Initially, Udo's aim was to devise a				method for determining who would reach heaven. He assumed each person's soul				was composed of independent parts he called "profanus" (profane) and "animi"				(spiritual), and represented these parts by a pair of numbers. Then he devised				rules for drawing and manipulating these number pairs. In effect, he devised				the rules for complex arithmetic, the spiritual and profane parts corresponding				to the real and imaginary numbers of modern mathematics.</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> In <EM>Salus</EM>, Udo describes how he used				these numbers: "Each person's soul undergoes trials through each of the				threescore years and ten of allotted life, [encompassing?] its own nature and				diminished or elevated in stature by others [it] encounters, wavering between				good and evil until [it is] either cast into outer darkness or drawn forever to				God."</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> When Schipke saw the translation, at once he saw				it for what it was: an allegorical description of the iterative process for				calculating the Mandelbrot. In mathematical terms, Udo's system was to start				with a complex number z, then iterate it up to 70 times by the rule z -&gt; z*z				+ c, until z either diverged or was caught in an orbit. [*4]</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> Below the description was drawn the first crude				plot of the Mandelbrot, which Udo called the "Divinitas" ("Godhead"). He set it				out in a 120x120 frame he termed a "columbarium" (i.e. a dovecote, which has a				similar grid of niches) and records that it took him nine years to calculate,				even with the newly imported technique of &#145;algorism', calculation with				Arabic numerals rather than abacus.</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> "It tends to be taken for granted," Schipke says,				"That the Mandelbrot is too calculation-intensive to be done without computers.				What we have to remember is the sheer devotion of the monastic life. This was a				labour of faith, and Udo was prepared to work for years. Some slowly-converging				pixels must have taken weeks."</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> Why did the work of this gifted mathematician go				unnoticed for so long? Schipke blames, in part, specialisation. "When the Codex				was unearthed in 1879, only a non-mathematician got to see it, and he didn't				know what he was looking at. It's a common enough story. Take Hildegard of				Bingen, whose accounts of her visions were taken as pure mysticism, but				neurologist Oliver Sacks instantly recognised them as accurate descriptions of				migraine symptoms. Likewise, literary critics dismissed Edgar Allan Poe's final				work, <EM>Eureka</EM>, as alcoholic ravings. But now scientists are finding				valid insights in it, such as Poe's correct solution of the Olbers paradox in				astronomy, or his coining of the classic Einsteinian phrase, 'Space and				duration are one'." [*9, *10]</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> "But there were also contemporary reasons why				Udo's knowledge didn't make it into the mainstream. His basic belief - that				salvation and damnation could be determined in advance - was heretical, and his				use of Arabic numerals was thought a bit of a black art. And there was the				disagreement with Thelonius."</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1">				<IMG SRC="codex.jpg" ALIGN="left" WIDTH="271" HEIGHT="413"				 ALT="Codex Udolphus"> Despite the borderline nature of his work, Udo impressed				his abbot at the monastery of Sankt Umbertus near Aachen. Life for a 13th				century monk wasn't necessarily austere: the scurrilous <EM>Cantiones				profanae</EM> poems record the delights of sex, eating, drinking and gambling.				In a footnote to <EM>Astragali</EM>, Udo writes: "My enumeration of the ways				[of dice] helped my lord abbot to win thirty-two florins and a fine new cloak				from the Burgermeister at Irrendorf, and he has promised me a helper for my				work".</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> But Udo and his helper, Thelonius, ran into				instant disagreement. Udo had always interpreted the Mandelbrot as signifying				God. Thelonius took the opposite view: that it represented the Devil. Numbers				that escaped to infinity, he argued, were souls flying free to heaven, and				those caught in an orbit had fallen into the pit of Hell. Like many theological				collaborations, they had a schism on their hands.</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> Udo noted that their differences brought all work				to a halt, and finally the two were reprimanded by the abbot for coming to				blows in the refectory. "Sadly I write," says Udo on the last page of the Codex				Udolphus, "that on pain of excommunication I must lay down my dice and my				numbers. I have seen into a realm of heavenly complexity, and my heart is heavy				that the door is now closed."</FONT></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> Bob Schipke comments: "It's a pity that personal				differences ended research that could have moved mathematics forward by				centuries. But fortunately, Udo couldn't leave the subject alone. By dropping				clues into the <EM>Cantiones profanae</EM> and the manuscripts he illuminated				later in his life, he ensured that we were able to recover his work and give				him the recognition that he deserves."</FONT></P></TD> 		</TR> 		<TR> 		  <TD> 			 <P><B>References:</B></P> 			 <P><FONT SIZE="-1"> [1] "The Benedictine Order: a Historical				Miscellany", edited by Rose M Wolanski, Springer-Verlag, 1965.<BR> [2] "Carmina				Burana, Frequently Asked Questions", by Charles Cave.				<A				HREF="http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/orff-cb/carmina.html">http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/orff-cb/carmina.html</A><BR>				[3] "O froehliche Weihnacht", ms. circa 1250 AD, Aachener				Dombibliothek, acquisition nr.
