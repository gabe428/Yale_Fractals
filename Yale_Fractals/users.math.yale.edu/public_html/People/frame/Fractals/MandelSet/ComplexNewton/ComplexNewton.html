Then a natural question is which initial guesses x<SUB>0</SUB> will iterate to which root?  For a given root, the collection of all such guesses is called the <FONT FORM COLOR = "RED">basin of attraction</FONT> of that root.  <A HREF="BasinEx/BasinEx.html">Here</A> is a simple example.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Cayley extended Newton's method to complex numbers and began the study of the <A HREF="NewtonBasins/NewtonBasins.html">basins of attraction</A> of the roots of complex functions.  The graphcal approach to this extension of Newton's method is difficult: the graph of a complex function is a four (real) dimensional object.  Here the formula is useful, because it can be applied to complex numbers as well as to real numbers.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Next we shall see how applying this method to a family of cubic polynomials led to the discovery that the Mandelbrot is <I>universal</I>, in a sense ubiquitous.</P> <P>Return to <A HREF="../welcome.html">the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets</A>.</P></BODY>
