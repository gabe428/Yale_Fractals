Here the pendulum is moving so rapidly that after it moves left and reverses direction, it crosses the left magnet so rapidly that it continues moving right before coming to rest over the right magnet.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="MechBasinBdry.html">Mechanical Basin Boundaries</A>.</P></BODY>
