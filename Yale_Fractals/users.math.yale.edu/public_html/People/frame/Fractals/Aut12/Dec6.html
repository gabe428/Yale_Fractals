In fact, as close as you look to any boundary point, you will find infinitely many little Mandelbrots.  The boundary is so "fuzzy" that it is 2-dimensional.  Also, the boundary is filled with points where a little bit of the Mandelbrot set looks like a little bit of the Julia set at that point.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../MandelSet/MandelBoundary/MandelBoundaryS.gif" WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=123></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="../MandelSet/MandelScalings/MandelScalings.html">Scalings in the Mandelbrot Set</A>.  The Mandelbrot set includes infinitely many smaller copies of itself.  These can be organized into hierarchical sequences for which the ratio of the sizes of successive copies approaches a limiting value.  Some of these give the Feigenbaum constant associated with the logistic map, others give new constants.  Some give integer limits.</TD>   <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../MandelSet/MandelScalings/MandelScalingsS.gif" WIDTH=79 HEIGHT=62></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD><A HREF="HW/HW10Ans.pdf">Homework 10 Solutions</A></TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
