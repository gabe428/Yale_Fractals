If the probability of blue is high enough, blue clusters span the lattice.  That is, blue flows (percolates) through the lattice.</TD></TR><TR><TD><A HREF="../Panorama/Biology/Bacteria/Bacteria.html">Bacterial Growth in Stressed Environments</A> Growing bacteria on media depleted of nutrient often yields colonies resembling DLA clusters.  The colony growth is limited by the nutrient diffusing in from the edge of the media, so this is no surprise.  But some propose another model: the colony shape is the result of communication among the bacteria.</TD></TR><TR><TD><A HREF="../Panorama/Astronomy/Galaxies/Galaxies.html">Large-Scale Distribution of Galaxies</A> Over some range of distances, the distribution of galaxies in the universe is lumpy and clumpy: clusters, superclusters, strings, walls, huge voids.  Does the entire universe exhibit this fractal structure?  Is it a result of the precise conditions of the Big Bang, or a natural consequence of the expansion that followed?</TD></TR><TR><TD><A HREF="../Panorama/Biology/Physiology/Physiology.html">Lungs</A>  The lungs are remarkable.
