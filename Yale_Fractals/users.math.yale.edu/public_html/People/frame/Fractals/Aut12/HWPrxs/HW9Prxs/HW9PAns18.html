(a) The N = 3 CA with LDL gives L, all other nbhd configs give D, produces picture (i).  Note that the only nbhd configs that appear in (i) are LDL and DLD, so ANY N = 3 CA with LDL gives L and DLD gives D produces picture (i).  The other six N = 3 nbhd configs can give either L or D without altering the pattern of (i).  Consequently, there are 2<SUP>6</SUP> = 64 different N = 3 CA rules that will produce picture (i).</TD></TR><TR><TD>(b)  Picture (ii) can be generated by no N = 3 or N = 5 CA.  For N = 3, all the nbhd congigs in the initial distribution are LLL.  This config must always produce a D cell, or always produce a L cell.  The checkerboard in later generations is impossible.</TD></TR><TR><TD>The same argument applies to N = 5, noting here that every nbhd config in the initial generation is LLLLL.  This must always produce a L cell, or always produce a D cell.  As with the N = 3 CA, the checkerboard pattern in later generations is impossible.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">(i) <IMG SRC="HW9P18a.gif" WIDTH=289 HEIGHT=145> &nbsp (ii)<IMG SRC="HW9P18b.gif" WIDTH=289 HEIGHT=145></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="HW9Prxs.html">Homework 9 Practice</A>.</P></BODY>
