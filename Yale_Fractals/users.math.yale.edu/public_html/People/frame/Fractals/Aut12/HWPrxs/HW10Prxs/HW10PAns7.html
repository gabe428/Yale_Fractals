Consequently for (i) we have a 5-cycle, for (ii) a 6-cycle, for (iii) an 8-cycle; (iv) is trickier: 2 spokes meet at some centers, 3 spokes at others.</TD></TR><TR><TD>For discs attached to the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set, the number of spokes gives the cycle number.  So we see 5 for (a), 6 for (b), 8 for (c), and 3 for (d).</TD></TR><TR><TD>But none of the Julia sets has 3 branches meeting at every center, so the disc in (d) must be the disc attached to the 3-cycle disc. Consequently, it is a a 6-cycle disc, the 2-cycle off the 3-cycle disc.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="HW10Prxs.html">Homework 10 Practice</A>.</P></BODY>
