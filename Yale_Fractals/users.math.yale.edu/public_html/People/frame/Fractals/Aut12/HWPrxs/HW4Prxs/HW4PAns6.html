(a) The dimension of the union is the max of the dimensions, so <NOBR>dim(A &#8746; C) = 1</NOBR> implies <NOBR>dim(C) = 1</NOBR>.  A product of Cantor sets made of <NOBR>N = 4</NOBR> pieces, each scaled by a factor of <NOBR>r = 1/4</NOBR>, suffices.</TD></TR><TR><TD>(b)  There is no set D: the intersection of A and D is a subset of A, and so the dimension of the intersection cannot exceed the dimension of A, itself less than 1.</TD></TR><TR><TD>(c) The dimension of the product is the sum of the dimensions, so we must have <NOBR>1 = dim(A) + dim(B)</NOBR>.
