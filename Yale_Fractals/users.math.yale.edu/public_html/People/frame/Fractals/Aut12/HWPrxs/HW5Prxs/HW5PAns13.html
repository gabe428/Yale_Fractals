Examining the f(&#945;) curves, we see two main similarities and two main differences.  For both, the dimension of the underlying set is 2, and for both the lowest value of &#945; occurs on a 1-dimensional subset.  The differences are that the highest value of &#945; occurs on a 1-dimensional subset for (a) and on a 0-dimensional subset for (b), and (b) has a wider range of &#945;-values.</TD></TR> <TR><TD>For both (c) and (d), the strong 2-3 diagonal line indicates T<SUB>2</SUB> and T<SUB>3</SUB> are applied with approximately equal high probabilities.  In (c), addresses 1 and 4 are visited with different probabilities, while in (d) it appears that addresses 1 and 4 are visited with approximately equal probabilities.  This suggests that IFS (d) corresponds to f(&#945;) curve (a), and IFS (c) corresponds to f(&#945;) curve (b).</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD></TR> <TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">(a)<IMG SRC="HW5P13a.gif" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=117> &nbsp (b)<IMG SRC="HW5P13b.gif" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=117></TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">(c) &nbsp <IMG SRC="HW5P13c.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200> &nbsp (d) &nbsp <IMG SRC="HW5P13d.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="HW5Prxs.html">Homework 5 Practice</A>.</P></BODY>
