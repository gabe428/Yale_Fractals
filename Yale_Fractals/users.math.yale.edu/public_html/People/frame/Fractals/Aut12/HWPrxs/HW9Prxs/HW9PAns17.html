The dead cell at C means the rule must include LDL gives D, contradicting the observation for A.  Consequently, these cannot be the first two rows of an N = 3 CA.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="HW9AnsP17.gif" WIDTH=289 HEIGHT=49></TD></TR><TR><TD>(b) The live cell A means the rule for an N = 5 CA must include DLDLD gives L.  The live cell at B means the rule must include DDLLD gives L.  All other nbhd configs give D.  Note the D cell at C is a consequence of LLDLD gives D.  Because LLDLD is not ne of the two nbhd configs, DLDLD and DDLLD, giving L, the dead cell at C causes no problem for an N = 5 CA.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="HW9Prxs.html">Homework 9 Practice</A>.</P></BODY>
