Here are two examples.</TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="../Chaos/FixedPoints/FixedPoints.html">Fixed points</A> are points x<SUB>*</SUB> left unchanged by the dynamics: f(x<SUB>*</SUB>) = x<SUB>*</SUB> for sequences generated by iterating a function f(x).  For graphical iteration, fixed points are seen as the intersections of y = f(x) and y = x.  The time series of a fixed point is a horizontal line.  Fixed points are <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">stable</FONT> or <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">unstable</FONT> according as nearby points approach or recede from the fixed point.</TD>    <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../Chaos/FixedPoints/StableFP/StableFPS.gif" WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=94></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">An N-<A HREF="../Chaos/Cycles/Cycles.html">cycle</A> is a collection of points x<SUB>1</SUB>, x<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., x<SUB>N</SUB>, that occur sequentially, with x<SUB>N</SUB> followed by x<SUB>1</SUB> and the pattern repeating.  For sequences generated by iterating a function f(x), the cycle is determined by x<SUB>2</SUB> = f(x<SUB>1</SUB>), x<SUB>3</SUB> = f(x<SUB>2</SUB>), ..., x<SUB>1</SUB> = f(x<SUB>N</SUB>).  These cycles are intersections of y = x and y = f<SUP>N</SUP>(x) = f(f(...f(x)...)).  Stability of a cycle is analogous to that of a fixed point.</TD>  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../Chaos/Cycles/CycleS.gif" WIDTH=102 HEIGHT=102></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>Here are three more ways to analyze chaotic data.</TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">The <A HREF="../Chaos/ReturnMap/ReturnMap.html">return map</A> is a plot of points <NOBR>(x<SUB>0</SUB>,x<SUB>1</SUB>)</NOBR>, <NOBR>(x<SUB>1</SUB>,x<SUB>2</SUB>)</NOBR>, <NOBR>(x<SUB>2</SUB>,x<SUB>3</SUB>)</NOBR>, <NOBR>(x<SUB>3</SUB>,x<SUB>4</SUB>)</NOBR>, ... .  For orbits of functions x<SUB>i+1</SUB> = f(x<SUB>i</SUB>), the return map just produces points on the graph y = f(x).  So for experimental data, the return map shows how well the data can be represented by one-dimensional dynamics.</TD>    <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../Chaos/ReturnMap/ReturnS.gif" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=110></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">For the <A HREF="../Chaos/DrIFS/DRIFS-2.html">driven IFS plot</A>, the range <NOBR>[orbit min, orbit max]</NOBR> is divided into four bins and the corners of the unit square are numbered 1 through 4.  Starting from <NOBR>(1/2,1/2)</NOBR>, the plot consists of points p<SUB>0</SUB>, p<SUB>1</SUB>, ... , where p<SUB>i+1</SUB> is the midpoint of p<SUB>i</SUB> and the corner numbered for the bin in which p<SUB>i</SUB> falls.</TD>    <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../Chaos/DrIFS/LogDrIFSS.gif" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=110></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">For a <A HREF="../Chaos/KellyPlot/KellyPlotS.html">Kelly plot</A>, the range <NOBR>[orbit min, orbit max]</NOBR> is divided into some number, N, of bins and a color is assigned to each bin.  Then small squares are colored sequentially, the color of each square is that of the bin into which the corresponding orbit point falls.  With some practice, this method can give a good visual test for uniform and Gaussian randomness, for intermittency, and other dynamics.</TD>  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../Chaos/KellyPlot/LogKellyS.gif" WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=110></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>Finally, we apply two of these techniques to the tent map and the logistic map.</TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="../Chaos/TLDrIFS/TLDrIFS.html">IFS driven</A> by the Tent Map and the Logistic Map reveal a new measure of complexity.  In some instances, the pattern is identical to that produced by a random IFS with certain pairs of transformations excluded.  Others require longer excluded combinations (triples, quadruples, etc.)  The number of excluded combinations is this measure of complexity.  Applied to real data, this suggests how many steps in the past are needed to determine the future.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../Chaos/TLDrIFS/TLDrIFSS.html" WIDTH=129 HEIGHT=129></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="../Chaos/TLKelly/TLKelly.html">Kelly plots</A> of the Tent Map and the Logistic Map produce some interesting patterns, but is it art?  Intermittency if clearly seen by this method (as in the picture on the right), and excluded combinations can be detected, though with more work than driven IFS.  On the other hand, some long-range correlations can be more readily seen.  Also, this method has more flexibility in the number of bins assigned to the data.  Driven IFS and Kelly plots complement one another nicely.</TD>  <TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="../Chaos/TLKelly/TLKellyS.gif" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=150></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
