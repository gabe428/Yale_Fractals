<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Sierpinski Tetrahedron</H1><H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Background</H2><P>One of the principal features of mathematical fractal structures is that scaling produces two or more copies of each stage, and this scaling is carried to infinitesimal detail.</P>  <P>In the natural physical world this can happen over only a limited range of scales.  The atoms making up a fern do not look like ferns.  For that matter, the cells of a fern do not look like ferns, either.</P>  <P>The tetrahedron we build illustrates this limited scaling range in a dramatic way, though with a variation:</P>  <UL>We are accustomed to start with the whole fractal and find within it scaled copies of itself.</UL> <UL>Here we start with a tetrahedron at the smallest level and use this to build larger shapes.</UL><P>This example serves another purpose as well.  In one of the first years of our fractals course, all the mathematical fractals happened to be subsets of the plane (more-or-less a consequence of comparatively primitive 3-dimensional graphics software available in our student lab), while all the natural fractals - cauliflower, broccoli, Queen Anne's lace, crumpled paper - were objects inhabiting 3-dimensional space.  The final examination included the problem to characterize the differences between natural and mathematical fractals.  The solution we expected was, "Mathematical fractals are exactly self-similar on all scales, while natural fractals are approximately self-similar over a limited range of scales."  While some students gave approximately that answer, many more wrote, "Mathematical fractals live on pieces of paper or computer screens, natural fractals live in the 3-dimensional world."  While true for the examples presented that semester, this is not the point we want to make.  The Sierpinski tetrahedron is a physical representation of a mathematical fractal that inhabits 3-dimensional space.</P><P>Return to <A HREF = "SierpTetraLab.html">Sierpinski Tetrahedron Project</A>.</P></BODY>
