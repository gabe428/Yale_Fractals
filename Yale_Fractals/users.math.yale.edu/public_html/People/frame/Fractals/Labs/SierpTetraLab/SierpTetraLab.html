Individuals make several unit tetrahedra and then work with others to complete the full tetrahedron.  The finished product is impressive and quite sturdy, but subject to the familiar effects of humidity on paper.  It is a good opportunity for photographs and for discussion of why the completed object is a fractal, and how fractals in nature differ from mathematical fractals.</P>  <P>An interesting aside is to compute the dimension of the limiting case of the mathematical fractal suggested by this tetrahedron structure. Since the mathematical fractal tetrahedron is self-similar, we can use the <A HREF = "../../FracAndDim/SimDim/SimDim.html">similarity dimension formula</A> <P ALIGN="CENTER">D = log N(r)/log (1/r),</P> <P>where N(r) is the number of scaled copies of size r.  We see </NOBR>N(r) = 4</NOBR> and <NOBR>r = 1/2.</NOBR>  Then <NOBR>D = log(4)/log(2)= 2log(2)/log(2) = 2.</NOBR>   Surprising!</P><P>Here is a <A HREF="STGallery.html">gallery</a> of pictures from a recent workshop.</P></BODY>
