That the data points fall near a straight line in the log-log plot vindicates the power law hypothesis <NOBR>M(r) = k r<SUP>d</SUP>.</P><P>For the paper balls, the slope of the line, and therefore the dimension, should be between 2 and 3. This value depends on the stiffness of the paper and whether it was reprocessed (crumpled, flattened, and recrumpled), among other factors.</P><P>For bean bags, the slope should be close to 3.</P><P>Here is a <A HREF="CPGallery.html">gallery</A> of pictures from a previous workshop.</P></BODY>
