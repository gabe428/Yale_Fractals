The logs of the data values from each experiment should fall approximately on a straight line.  For the paper balls, the slope of the line, and therefore the dimension, should be between 2 and 3.  If we ignore its thickness, a flat sheet of paper has dimension 2; consequently, a crumpled paper ball must have dimension at least 2. On the other hand, a solid ball has dimension 3; consequently, a crumpled paper ball must have simension at most 3.</P><P>Think of gradually deforming the flat sheet into a solid ball.  As the crumpled paper becomes more like a ball, the dimension gets closer to 3.  Why does its dimension not increase to 3?  The crumpling process generates spaces of a range of sizes, preventing hte dimension from reaching 3.  Stiff paper has a wider range of space sizes, including some that are relatively large, giving a dimension closer to 2.  For light weight paper (or reprocessed paper), the range of space sizes is smaller, giving a dimension closer to 3.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="CPLExerc.html">Exercises</A></P></BODY>
