For the paper balls, the slope of the line, and therefore the dimension, should be between 2 and 3. This value depends on the stiffness of the paper and whether it was reprocessed (crumpled, flattened, and recrumpled).  In all cases, crumpling paper produces a wide range of sizes of cavities within the paper ball.  This range of sizes lowers the paper ball dimension below 3.</P><P>On the other hand, the bean bags are composed of uniform size beans which tightly pack, leaving spaces of about the same size.  Because the bean bags do not have a range of sizes of spaces, within experimental error the bean bags should have dimension 3.</P><P>(Uniform size spaces do not affect dimension, but they do decrease the average density. Do you see why the average density of a bean bag is lower than the average density of a bean?)</P><P>Return to <A HREF="CPLExerc.html">Exercises</A></P></BODY>
