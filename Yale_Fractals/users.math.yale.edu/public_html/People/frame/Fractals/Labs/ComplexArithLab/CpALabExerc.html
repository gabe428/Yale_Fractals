Plot them on a piece of graph paper.  All the exercises will be based on these numbers.</P><P>1. (a) Calculate (1 + i)*A, (1 + i)*B, (1 + i)*C, and (1 + i)*D and plot these points.</P><P>(b) Calculate 2i*A, 2i*B, 2i*C, and 2i*D and plot these points.</P><P>(c) Calculate (-2 + 2i)*A, (2i)*B, (2i)*C, and (2i)*D and plot these points.</P><P>(d)  By examples convince yourself that for any complex numbers u, v, and w, if c lies on the line beteen u and v, then w*c lies on the line between w*u and w*v.  Can you prove this in general?  Use this information to find the images of the box with corners A, B, C, and D under the multiplications in (a), (b), and (c).</P><P>Here is the <A HREF="Ex1Ans.html">answer</A>.</P><P>2.
