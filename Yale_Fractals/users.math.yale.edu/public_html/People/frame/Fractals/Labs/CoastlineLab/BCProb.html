<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Dimension by Box-Counting</H1><H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Background - A Problem</H2><P>An obvious test of this approach is to compute the box-counting dimension for a fractal having known dimension, established by other methods.</P>  <P>Attempts using even relatively simple shapes, such as the Koch curve, were disappointing.  Class projects (admittedly with only a few sizes of grid squares) yielded dimension values ranging from 1.1 to 1.4., while the correct answer is about 1.26.</P>  <P>A source of this problem is that the number of boxes counted at a specific scale is sensitive to the placement of the grid on the picture.  Of course, grid placement does not affect the limit as <NOBR>r -> 0,</NOBR> but it can have a significant impact on the slope of the best-fitting line when only a limited scaling range of r values is used.</P><P>We explore this effect in our <A HREF="GPDimDir.html">grid placement</A> investigations.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="CoastlineBackground.html">Background</A>.</P></BODY>
