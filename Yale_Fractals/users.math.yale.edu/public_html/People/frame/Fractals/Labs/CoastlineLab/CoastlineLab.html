In addition, the range of sizes of the boxes is limited by the physicality of the box-counting process.  Finally, the result often is sensitive to the placement of the grids.  This latter effect is not an issue for mathematical fractals in the <NOBR>box size -> 0</NOBR> limit.  For dimensions estimated over a limited range of scales, we must consider the proper counting strategy.  Choices include averaging the counts for different grid placements, for each size using the median of the counts for different displacements, or using the smallest count of each grid size.</P>  <P><A HREF="BCDataSheet1.html">Manual Box-counting data sheet</A></P><P><A HREF="BCDataSheet2.html">Computer Box-counting data sheet</A>  The box-counting software does these computations, but you may use these tables for comparisons in the grid-placement problems.</P><P><A HREF="BCOffsetSheet.html">Grid offset exercises</A></P></BODY>
