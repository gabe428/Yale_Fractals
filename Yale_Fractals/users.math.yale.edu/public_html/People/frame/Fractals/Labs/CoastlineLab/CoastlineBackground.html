Here we will be looking at the dimension of objects which are subsets of the Euclidean plane.</P>  <P>The box-counting dimension formula will be motivated by considering the relationship between the scale at which a self-similar shape is viewed and the number of scaled copies of the shape contained within the shape.  (This is the <I>similarity dimension</I>.)</P>  <P>Box-counting generalizes this relationship to shapes that are not exactly self-similar.</P><P><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">We begin with dimensions of familiar <A HREF="EuclideanDimension.html">Euclidean objects</A>, viewed in a way different from the intuitive <I>number of independent directions</I>.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="EucDimS.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">From this we deduce a <A HREF="Scaling.html">scaling relationship</A> that  holds in circumstances more general than lines, squares, and cubes.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="ScalingS.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Now we apply the scaling relation to define the <A HREF="SGKCDim.html">dimensions the Sierpinski gasket and of the Koch curve</A>.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="SGKCDimS.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">To define a dimension for natural fractals, we generalize this construction to the <A HREF="BoxCountingDef.html">box-counting dimension</A>.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="BoxCountS.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Finally, we point out a <A HREF="BCProb.html">problem</A> associated with counting a small range of scales.</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="BCProbS.gif" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="CoastlineLab.html">Dimension by Box-Counting</A>.</P></BODY>
