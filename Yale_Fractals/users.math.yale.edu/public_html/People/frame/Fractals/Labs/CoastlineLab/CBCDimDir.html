<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Computer Box-Counting Directions</H1><P>The box counting dimension of a shape in the plane can be estimated by the slope of the plot of <NOBR>Log(number of boxes to cover the shape)</NOBR> vs <NOBR>Log(1/box side length).</NOBR></P><P>1. Load the <A HREF="../../Software/boxdim.html">Box-Counting software</A>.</P><P>2. Select a picture from the Choose Map button, and a grid size from the Boxes button.  Start with grid size 64.</P><P>3. Determine which grid boxes you wish to count and count them by clicking on them.  Selected boxes are shaded in <FONT COLOR="RED">red</FONT>.  In the Box Counts list, the current box size is printed in <FONT COLOR="RED">red</FONT>, the current count beside it, also in <FONT COLOR="RED">red</FONT>.</P><P>4. Clicking again on a selected box deselects it.  The Zoom button can be used to help decide if boxes near the boundary of the shape contain any portion of it.</P><P>5. After reaching a final box-count at one scale, choose another scale from the Boxes and continue to box-count until all the desired scales have been used.  Box size 8 and 4 are quite small and can safely be avoided when learning the mechanics of box-counting.</P><P>6. As soon as a second size of boxes is selected, the dimension is estimated.  Every change in the number of selected boxes alters this estimate, so this number estimates the dimension only when box-counting has been completed.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="CoastlineProcedure.html">Procedure</A>.</P></BODY>
