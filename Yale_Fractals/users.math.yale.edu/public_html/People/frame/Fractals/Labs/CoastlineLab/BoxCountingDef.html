<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Dimension by Box-Counting</H1><H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Background - Box-Counting Dimension</H2><P>Natural fractals do not contain similar copies of themselves.  How can we measure their dimension if there is no apparent scaling factor?</P>  <P>Motivated by our Euclidean observations, we</P> <UL>cover the shape with a grid of boxes and count the number of boxes that touch any part of the shape.</UL>  <UL>Repeat for grids of smaller and smaller boxes.</UL><P>Denoting by N(r) the number of grid boxes of side length r touching any part of the shape, we adopt the <I>assumption</I>, and it is an assumption, that</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">N(r) = k((1/r)<SUP>d</SUP>),</P>  <P>where k is the constant of proportionality, 1 in our previous examples.  Solve for d by taking the log of both sides, obtaining</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">log(N(r)) = dlog(1/r) + log(k).</P>  <P>Here d and k are constants, <NOBR>log(N(r))</NOBR> and <NOBR>log(1/r)</NOBR> vary with r, so this has the form</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">y = mx + b</P><P>of the equation of a straight line with slope d.  Because d is interpreted as a dimension in our original <A HREF="Scaling.html">scaling relation</A>, we interpret it as a dimension in this more general setting.  This d is called the <FONT COLOR="RED">box-counting dimension</FONT>.</P>  <P>Suppose we have counted boxes for grids with side lengths r<SUB>1</SUB>, r<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., r<SUB>N</SUB>.  To calculate d from these box counts</P><UL>plot the points <NOBR>(log(r<SUB>1</SUB>), log(N(r<SUB>1</SUB>))),</NOBR> ..., <NOBR>(log(r<SUB>N</SUB>), log(N(r<SUB>N</SUB>))),</NOBR> then</UL><UL>find the best-fitting line through these points and measure its slope.</UL><P>If the assumpton N(r) = k((1/r)<SUP>d</SUP>) is correct, the points should lie (approximately) on a straight line.  This is some evidence for fractality, though in general more is needed; for example, if the shape exhibits similar sorts of structure over a range of scales.</P>  <P>For natural fractals the relation <NOBR>N(r) = k((1/r)<SUP>d</SUP>)</NOBR> holds only for a limited collection of r values, the <FONT FORM COLOR = "RED">scaling range</FONT>.</P>  <P>Box-counting dimension can be computed for mathematical fractals.  In general, more detail is revealed with smaller r values going to 0, so for mathematical fractals we take the limit</P><P ALIGN = "CENTER">d = lim<SUB>r -> 0</SUB> (log(N(r)) - log(k))/log(1/r)</P><P>Because k is a constant, an equivalent and simpler formulation is</P><P ALIGN = "CENTER">d = lim<SUB>r -> 0</SUB> log(N(r))/log(1/r)</P><P>For natural fractals with a limited scaling range, this limit may not be the most successful approach.  Rather, we rely on plotting the points <NOBR>(log(1/r), log(N(r))),</NOBR> identifying the scaling range, and finding the slope of the best-fitting line through the points in the scaling range.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="CoastlineBackground.html">Background</A>.</P></BODY>
