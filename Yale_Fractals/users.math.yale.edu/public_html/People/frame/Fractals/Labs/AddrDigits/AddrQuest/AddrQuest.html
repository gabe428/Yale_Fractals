<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Some Basic Questions on Decimals through Addresses</H2><P><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD><TABLE><TR><TD>1. <B>Subdividing the inch</B> Consider an inch. We shall successively subdivide it into halves, and the halves into halves, and so on. Seeking the scaled patterns within patterns is a natural approach for people accustomed to thinking about fractals.</TD></TR><TR><TD>(a) First, divide the inch into halves, left and right. To each point in this inch we assign an address, 0 to the points on the left half, 1 to the points on the right half. Because an address of 0 means the point is less than <NOBR>1/2</NOBR> and an address of 1 means the point is greater than <NOBR>1/2</NOBR>, we can think of this address as giving the number of <NOBR>1/2</NOBR>s in the point.  <A HREF="Ex1aAns.html">Answer</A></TD></TR><TR><TD>(b) Next divide each half into halves of halves, that is, into quarters. The second address digit, 0 or 1, indicates whether the point is in the left or right side of the half to which it belongs.  Write the address digits of these four intervals and interpret the address of each interval in terms of the number of <NOBR>1/4</NOBR>s of each point of the interval.  (Ignore the endpoints of each interval.  Addresses of these points are treated in problem 5.)  <A HREF="Ex1bAns.html">Answer</A></TD></TR><TR><TD>(c) Now divide the quarters into eighths. Write the address digits of these eight intervals.  <A HREF="Ex1cAns.html">Answer</A></TD></TR><TR><TD>(d) Note the order of the address digits. The first (left) digit tells us to which half of the inch the point belongs, the next digit to which half of that half, and so on. Compare this with the usual order we write addresses on letters (physical mail, not email).  Give a concrete example to illustrate your interpretation.    <A HREF="Ex1dAns.html">Answer</A></TD></TR><TR><TD>(e) To strengthen the tie to fractals, find two transformations f<SUB>0</SUB> and f<SUB>1</SUB> that generate <NOBR>[0, 1]</NOBR> as an IFS.  Show that the order of the address digits is identical to the order of the composition of these functions.  <A HREF="Ex1eAns.html">Answer</A></TD></TR></TABLE><TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE><TR><TD>2. <B>Locating numbers</B> If x lies in the interval with address 0, we know <NOBR>0 <= x <= 1/2.</NOBR>  If x lies in the interval with address 1, we know <NOBR>1/2 <= x <= 1.</NOBR></TD></TR><TR><TD>(a) What can be said about a point x in the interval with address 0110?  <A HREF="Ex2aAns.html">Answer</A></TD></TR><TR><TD>(b) Find the intervals of address length 1, 2, 3, and 4 that contain the point <NOBR>x = 2/7.</NOBR>  <A HREF="Ex2bAns.html">Answer</A></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE><TR><TD>3. <B>Place values</B> In decimal epansions, the first digit to the right of the decimal is the tenths, the second is the hundredths, and so on.</TD></TR><TR><TD>(a)  In binary expansions, find the first place with value smaller than one-thousandth.  <A HREF="Ex3aAns.html">Answer</A></TD></TR><TR><TD>(b)  Solve problem (a) using base 2 logarithms, using base 10 logarithms.  <A HREF="Ex3bAns.html">Answer</A></TD></TR><TR><TD>(c)  Decimal expansions correspond to subdividing each interval into ten pieces, binary expansions into two.  Into how many pieces must each interval be subdivided so the fourth place corresponds to about 0.0004?  <A HREF="Ex3cAns.html">Answer</A></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE><TR><TD>4. <B>Comparing numbers</B> In decimal, changing the 5<SUP>th</SUP> digit moves a point by <NOBR>0.00001 = 10<SUP>-5</SUP></NOBR>.  In binary, changing the 5<SUP>th</SUP> digit moves a point by <NOBR>2<SUP>-5</SUP> = 0.03125.</NOBR></TD></TR><TR><TD>(a)  Which binary digits must be changed to move a point by <NOBR>3/16</NOBR>?  by <NOBR>11/16</NOBR>?  <A HREF="Ex4aAns.html">Answer</A></TD></TR><TR><TD>(b)  Which binary digits must be changed to move a point by 1/3?  by 1/7?  by 1/15?

Locate the points 0<SUP>infinity</SUP>, 1(0<SUP>infinity</SUP>), 12(0<SUP>infinity</SUP>), 13(0<SUP>infinity</SUP>), 132(0<SUP>infinity</SUP>), and 133(0<SUP>infinity</SUP>).  Compute the angles between successive chords from these points to the apex.  <A HREF="KochAddr/MultAddr.html">Answer</A></TD></TR><TR><TD>(d) Next, we consider points with addresses ending in an infinite sequence of 1s or an infinite sequence of 2s.  For example, take the point 1<SUP>infinity</SUP> and consider the sequence of chords to this point from 1(0<SUP>infinity</SUP>), 11(0<SUP>infinity</SUP>), 111(0<SUP>infinity</SUP>), and so on.  What is the general pattern?  <A HREF="KochAddr/LoxAddr.html">Answer</A></TD></TR><TR><TD>(e) Addresses that terminate in a constant are treated in parts (c) and (d).  Given any address a<SUB>1</SUB>a<SUB>2</SUB>a<SUB>3</SUB>... that does not terminate in a constant string, what can be said about the angles of the chords to a<SUB>1</SUB>a<SUB>2</SUB>a<SUB>3</SUB>... from a<SUB>1</SUB>a<SUB>2</SUB>a<SUB>3</SUB>...a<SUB>k</SUB>(0<SUP>infinity</SUP>) for <NOBR>k = 1, 2, 3, ...?</NOBR>  <A HREF="KochAddr/GenAddr.html">Answer</A></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
