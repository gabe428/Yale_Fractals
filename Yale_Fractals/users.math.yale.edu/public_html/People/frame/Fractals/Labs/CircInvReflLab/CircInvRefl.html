Born around 262 BC, Apollonius studied under the successors of Euclid and introduced inversion in his last book, <I>Plane Loci</I>.  Circle inversion is analogous to reflection over a line, with the circle taking the place of the reflecting line. Unlike reflection across a line, circle inversion has nonlinear properties.  Reflections in a curved plastic sheet can simulate some properties of inversion.  Colored plastic (red appears to work well) allows simultaneous viewing of the reflection and the objects behind the plastic.</P><P><B>Exercises</B></P><P><I>General instruction</I>  These exercises are best done with a partner: one person  to hold the plastic sheet usually in a bent configuration, the other to sight and trace figures.  Expect (small) experimental errors.</P><P>1. <A HREF="CircInvRefl1.html">Linear reflection</A></P><P>2. <A HREF="CircInvRefl2.html">Expansion and contraction</A></P><P>3. <A HREF="CircInvRefl3.html">Lines and circles</A></P><P>4. <A HREF="CircInvRefl4.html">Distrances between reflected points</A></P></BODY>
