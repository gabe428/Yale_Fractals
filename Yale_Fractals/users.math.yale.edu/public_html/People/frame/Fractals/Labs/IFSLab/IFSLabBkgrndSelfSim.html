These are characterized by the property that</P> <UL>each is composed of infinitely many exact copies of itself.</UL>  <P>One of the most famous of these is the Sierpinski Gasket, shown below.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="GasketMag.gif" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=210></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><B>The Sierpinski Gasket with one of the three large copies of itself magnified to show detail</B></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>It is easy to see that this fractal is made up of copies of itself: it has three large copies, one of which is shown magnified.</P>  <P>These in turn contain copies of copies of copies, etc.</P>  <P>Note that in theory the complete gasket is the limit set of an infinite process, and as a result, any picture we can see is not the actual gasket but a stage in the process of generating the gasket.  No one has ever physically seen a complete gasket, or any other self-similar fractal, except with our minds' imagery.</P><P>Return to <A HREF = "IFSLabBackground.html">Finding IFS for Fractal Images - Background</A></P></BODY>
