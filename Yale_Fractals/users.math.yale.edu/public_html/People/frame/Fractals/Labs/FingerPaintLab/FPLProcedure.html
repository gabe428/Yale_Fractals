This can be repeated several times, and at each repetition the top paper can be replaced in the same orientation, or rotated some relative to its previous placement.</P><P>These experiments can be quantified by</P> <UL>counting the number of branches off the longest branch and</UL> <UL>the ratio of the lengths of successive branches.</UL>  <P>Once scanned, box-counting can be used to estimate the dimension of the longest branch. </P><P>A bit of reflection should yield other experiments.  The sample shows an interesting direction taken in recent student projects.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="FingerPaintLab.html">Finger Paint Lab</A>.</P> </BODY>
