Reflection off spheres is similar to <A HREF="../../CircInvFrac/Welcome-2.html">inversion in circles</A>.  This providessome of the reason for the richness of these images.  Do circle inversion fractals suggest arrangements of the reflecting spheres that might produce interesting images?</P></BODY>
