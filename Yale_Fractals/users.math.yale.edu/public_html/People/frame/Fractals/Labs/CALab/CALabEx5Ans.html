I haven't found any pattern substantially different from this, regardless of the starting configuration.  However, a closer look would reveal differences, because in {\it A New Kind of Science}, Wolfram reports that Matthew Cook has proved this CA is capable of universal computation.  For example, it is possible to find an initial configuration so at a predetermined generation the state of the auomaton encodes the trillionth decimal digit of pi.  This is the simplest CA known to be a universal computer.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="CALabEx5.html">Exercise 5</A>.</P></BODY>
