To get rid of the lump on the left side of the central part of the leaf, we widen the second copy and move it back to the right: change r<SUB>2</SUB> to 0.8 and e<SUB>2</SUB> to -0.3.  To soften the jagged top of the central part, we move the fourth part down by changing f<SUB>4</SUB> to 1.75.  Here is the picture, together with the IFS producing it.</P><P><TABLE><TD><IMG SRC="IFSLeaf5.gif" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=183><TD><IMG SRC="WholeLeafOutline.gif" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=144></TABLE></P><P><TABLE BORDER><TD> <TD>r <TD>s <TD>theta <TD>e <TD>f <TR><TD>T<SUB>1</SUB> <TD>.65 <TD>.75 <TD>-30 <TD>.7 <TD>.3 <TR><TD>T<SUB>2</SUB> <TD>.80 <TD>.60 <TD>45 <TD>-.3 <TD>.5 <TR><TD>T<SUB>3</SUB> <TD>.7 <TD>.7 <TD>0 <TD>0 <TD>0 <TR><TD>T<SUB>4</SUB> <TD>.25 <TD>.4 <TD>0 <TD>.2 <TD>1.75</TABLE></P><P>This is a bit better match, but additional refinements still could improve the image.  Not, however, that the outline of the IFS-generated image will be a fractal on all levels, while a real leaf has this property over only a few levels.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="LeafLabSample.html">Sample</A>.</P></BODY>
