<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">A Fractal Leaf by IFS</H1><H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Background</H2><P>The inverse problem for IFS (finding the transformations to generate a given image) usually is introduced with fairly simple mathematical fractals.  We did this in <A HREF="../IFSLab/IFSLab.html">Finding IFS for Fractal Images</A>, where the basic IFS parameters are introduced.  More complicated examples are presented in <A HREF="../SpiralsLab/SpiralsLab.html">Spiral Fractals from IFS</A>.</P><P>Still, the often stated ability of fractals to make convincing forgeries of natural objects is satisfied only in part with abstract ferns, trees, and Queen Anne's lace.  To see a more direct example, we take the outline of a real leaf and use scaled copies of the outline to find IFS rules for generating an approximation of the leaf.  That a leaf is just approximately fractal, and that over only a few levels, adds a complication to the method of finding IFS rules for exact mathematical fractals.  However, we shall see that the familiar methd can be modified to a successive approximation approach that seems to work reasonably well.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="LeafLab.html">A Fractal Leaf by IFS</A>.</P></BODY>
