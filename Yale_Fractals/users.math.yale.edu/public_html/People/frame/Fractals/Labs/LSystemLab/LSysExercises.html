Find a relation between each step and the next.  Using twist-ties, construct models of these steps.  Determine a physical process for generating a model of any step desired.  Note that no rescaling goes on here.  All steps have straight segments of the same length, and successive steps get larger and larger.  <A HREF="LSysEx3Ans.html">Answer</A></P><P>When the steps are rescaled, the limiting shape is called the <I>Dragon curve</I>.  A very interesting alternative to L-Systems is the paperfolding approach described by Vicki Fegers and Mary Beth Johnson in their chapter "Fractals - energizing the mathematics classroom" of <I>Fractals, Graphics, and Mathematics Education</I>.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="LSystemLab.html">L-Systems: Patterns with Grammar</A></P></BODY>
