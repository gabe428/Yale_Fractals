With the geometric interpretations of the alphabet, draw the figure defined by the string.  Alternately, assemble a figure consisting of a small number of steps with twist-ties (these bend easily and keep their shape).  Then build figures consisting of a larger number of steps by assembling copies of the twist-tie figures.</P><P>With L-System software this is much simpler: enter the axiom, production rules, turning angle, and number of steps.  Then run the program.</P><P><I>Inverse Problem</I>  Given a figure, find the axiom and production rules that generate the figure.  Generally, many combinations of axioms and production rules can yield a given figure, and some of these will disagree on later steps.  So we settle for a simpler problem.  Given two (consecutive, early) steps, find the axiom and production rule.  This is a pattern-recognition problem; it becomes easier with practice.<P> <P>Return to <A HREF="LSystemLab.html">L-Systems: Patterns with Grammar</A></P></BODY>
