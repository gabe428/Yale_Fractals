<HEAD><TITLE>Fractal Geometry</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">L-Systems: Patterns with Grammar</H1><H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Background</H2><P>In the late 1960s by Aristid Lindenmayer developed L-Systems as a method for modeling plant growth.  An L-system is a rewriting system, a way of constructing complex objects by starting with simple objects and recursively replacing parts of the object according to rewriting rules.  We begin with an example of a simple L-system that generates the Koch curve, but first, some terminology.</P><P>An <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">L-System</FONT> is made up of an alphabet A, an axiom S, and a set P of production rules.</P><P>The <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">alphabet</FONT> is a set of symbols (we'll take our symbols from +, -, x, y, F, and f), and an L-system describes a rewriting of strings of symbols from the alphabet.</P><P>The <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">axiom</FONT> is the initial string upon which the L-system operates.</P><P>The <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">production rules</FONT> assign to each letter a of the alphabet a string P(a) of letters of the alphabet.</P><P><A HREF="LSysKoch.html">Example 1</A>: generating the Koch curve by L-Systems.</P><P>The alphabet need not consist of symbols that involve drawing, moving, and turing.  Other symbols can be introduced to allow different substitutions at different parts of a string, as seen in the next example.</P><P><A HREF="LSysHilbert.html">Example 2</A>: generating Hilbert's space-filling curve by L-Systems.</P> <P>Finally, the symbol f is usually interpreted as moving forward one step without drawing a line.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="LSystemLab.html">L-Systems: Patterns with Grammar</A></P></BODY>
