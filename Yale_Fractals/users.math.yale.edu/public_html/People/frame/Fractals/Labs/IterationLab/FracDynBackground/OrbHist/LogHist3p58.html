So in some sense, we could think of this as a <FONT FORM COLOR="RED">noisy 4-cycle</FONT>.  Probably the orbit is chaotic, restricted to these four bands.  However, by examining the histograms alone, we cannot be sure we aren't looking at a 16384-cycle, for example.  Histograms can tell some things, but not all things.</TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY>
