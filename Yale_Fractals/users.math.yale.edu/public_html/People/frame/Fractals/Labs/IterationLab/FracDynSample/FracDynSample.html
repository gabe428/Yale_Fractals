At the start and occasionally later there appears to be a repeating pattern of five colors: <FONT COLOR="#6373B5"><B>grey</B></FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#8C007B"><B>purple</B></FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#083194"><B>dark blue</B></FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#DE5AAD"><B>pink</B></FONT>, and <FONT COLOR="#8C007B"><B>purple</B></FONT>.  Despite this pattern, certainly a 5-cycle is not present.</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Time series</B> If the Kelly plot appears to give a 5-cycle at the beginning, why do we see what appears to be four repeated values in the time series?  Try magnifying horizontally.  Are all the lines segments straight?  Here is a <A HREF="javascript:location='FracDynSample.html';window.open('Ans2M.html','Sample','WIDTH=510,HEIGHT=230,scrollbar=yes')">magnification</A>.</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Histogram</B> The points seem to cluster about five bars, but with many more points scattered between.  Rerun the program taking the initial point as close as possible to the value of one the histogram bars.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P><TABLE><TR><TD>3. For the logistic map select <NOBR>s = 3.7425.</NOBR>  Interpret the eventual behavior of the iterates using the histogram, time series, and Kelly plot.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Here are the <A HREF="javascript:location='FracDynSample.html';window.open('Ans3.html','Sample','WIDTH=720,HEIGHT=550,scrollbar=yes')">pictures</A>.</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Kelly plot</B> The Kelly plot shows a repeating pattern of five colors: <FONT COLOR="#6373B5"><B>grey</B></FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#8C007B"><B>purple</B></FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#083194"><B>dark blue</B></FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#DE5AAD"><B>pink</B></FONT>, and <FONT COLOR="#8C007B"><B>purple</B></FONT>.  This could indicate a <NOBR>5-cycle,</NOBR> but the width of the bins can hide more complicated behaviors.</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Time series</B> The time series looks like a <NOBR>5-cycle,</NOBR> as does a magnification at first glance.  However, a <A HREF="javascript:location='FracDynSample.html';window.open('Ans3M.html','Sample','WIDTH=510,HEIGHT=230,scrollbar=yes')">careful comparison</A> of the heights reveals at least 9 values, and maybe 10.  This is clearest in the next-to-the-lowest line.</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Histogram</B> The histogram reveals the clearest interpretation.  The three middle values clearly separate into pairs, as does the lowest value, although there the histogram bars are adjacent.  The top appears to be a single bar, but having length twice that of the other bars.  Recalling that the histogram bars correspond to bins of nonzero width, we see the top bin must contain two cycle points. </TD></TR><TR><TD></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="../IterationLab.html">Visualizing Iteration Patterns</A>.</P></BODY>
