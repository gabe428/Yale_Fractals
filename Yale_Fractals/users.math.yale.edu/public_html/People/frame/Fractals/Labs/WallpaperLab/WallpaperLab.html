The hangings will increase in size as the number of stages increase.</P><P><B>Materials</B> 1,084 one inch square pictures (the same or different, perhaps pictures of students), scissors, glue sticks, clear tape, 361 pieces of white 2 by 2 inch paper, 120 pieces of white 4 by 4 inch paper, 40 pieces of white 8 by 8 inch paper.</P><P>Optional (if you are generating your own pictures) a digital picture, a computer, software for cropping and resizing pictures, software for cutting and pasting, a printer.</P><P><A HREF="WallpaperLabBackground.html">Background</A></P><P><A HREF="WallpaperLabProcedure.html">Procedure</A></P><P><TABLE><TR><TD><B>Conclusion</B>  This method of growing fractals by accretion gives a physical sense of how the same process operates on different scales.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>By taking photos as the atoms of the fractal, we have a clear example of how different features are visible at different scales.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>If photos of students are used, mixing the pictures before beginning the assembly process can generate interesting discussions.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>The basic idea of this construction was presented by Vicki Fegers and Mary Beth Johnson in their chapter "Fractals - energizing the mathematics classroom" of <I>Fractals, Graphics, and Mathematics Education</I>.</P><P>Here are some pictures of the construction carried out in a <A HREF="WSPictures/WSPictures.html">recent workshop</A>.</P></BODY>
