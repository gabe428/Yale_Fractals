Describe the reflections on terms of sides or angles of the polygons.  You may need different descriptions for polygons with an odd or an even number of sides. <A HREF="PTAns3p1.html">Answer</A></P><P>2.  Certainly, all the rotations can be generated by compositions of rotation by <NOBR>(1/n)360 deg</NOBR>.  Perhaps less obviously, all reflections are compositions of any given reflection and a rotation.  Illustrate this by showing reflection across a diagonal of a square is the same as a rotation followed by reflection across the perpendicular bisector of two opposite sides.  Can you prove this in general?  (Hint: any orientation-preserving symmetry of a regular <NOBR>n-gon</NOBR> is one of the rotations.  Suppose c and d are two reflection symmetries of an <NOBR>n-gon.</NOBR>  Then cd is orientation-preserving, hence is one of the rotations.) <A HREF="PTAns3p2.html">Answer</A></P><P>Consequently, the group D<SUB>n</SUB> is generated by rotation a through <NOBR>(1/n)360 deg,</NOBR> and a reflection b.  Denote by 1 the identity symmetry, and observe that <NOBR>a<SUP>n</SUP> = 1</NOBR> and <NOBR>b<SUP>2</SUP> = 1.</NOBR>  Are there other relations?</P><P>3.  By studying the pentagon and hexagon templates, show <NOBR>bab = a<SUP>-1</SUP>.</NOBR>  Show this relation is equivalent to <NOBR>(ab)<SUP>2</SUP> = 1.</NOBR> <A HREF="PTAns3p3.html">Answer</A></P><P>4.  Show <NOBR>a<SUP>n</SUP> = 1,</NOBR> <NOBR>b<SUP>2</SUP> = 1,</NOBR> and <NOBR>(ab)<SUP>2</SUP> = 1</NOBR> are the only relations.  That is, if some other combination w of a and b satisfies <NOBR>w = 1,</NOBR> then the three relations can be used to show w is equivalent to one of the relations. <A HREF="PTAns3p4.html">Answer</A></P><P>In abstract terms, the dihedral group of order 2n is written</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">D<SUB>n</SUB> = < a,b: a<SUP>n</SUP> = b<SUP>2</SUP> = (ab)<SUP>2</SUP> = 1></P><P>Return to <A HREF="PTExercises.html">Exercises</A>.</P></BODY>
