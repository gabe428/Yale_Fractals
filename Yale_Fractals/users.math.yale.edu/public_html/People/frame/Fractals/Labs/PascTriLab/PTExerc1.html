On a <A HREF="PTTemplate.gif" TARGET="BLANK">Pascal's triangle template</A> shade the squares containing odd numbers.  Using the arithmetic facts odd + odd = even, even + even = even, odd + even = odd, and even + odd = odd, explain why the Sierpinski gasket appears.</P><P>Hint: explain why the next-to-the leftmost column and the first subdiagonal (the diagonal immediately below the hypotenuse of the triangle, whose squares all contain 1s) alternate even and odd numbers.  Does this suggest a way to approach the general problem?</P><P>2. On a <A HREF="PTTemplate.gif" TARGET="BLANK">Pascal's triangle template</A> shade the squares containing numbers that are not multiples of 3.  Use addition mod 3 to explain why a relative of the Sierpinski gasket appears.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="PTExercises.html">Exercises</A>.</P></BODY>
