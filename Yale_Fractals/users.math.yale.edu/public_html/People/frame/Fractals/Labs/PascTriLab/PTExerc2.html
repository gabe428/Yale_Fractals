(mod 4): Look at Pascal's triangle <NOBR>(mod 4).</NOBR>  Shade the squares congruent to <NOBR>0 (mod 4).</NOBR>  Shade the squares congruent to <NOBR>1 (mod 4).</NOBR>  Shade the squares congruent to <NOBR>2 (mod 4).</NOBR>  Shade the squares congruent to <NOBR>3 (mod 4).</NOBR>  Do you see a pattern?  Now shade the squares congruent to <NOBR>1, 2, or 3 (mod 4).</NOBR>  Shade the squares congruent to <NOBR>0 or 2 (mod 4);</NOBR> shade the squares congruent to <NOBR>1 or 3 (mod 4).</NOBR>  How can we explain this pattern? <A HREF="PTAns2p1.html">Answer</A></P><P>2.

Which combinations of squares will give clean fractal pictures?  What other Pascal's triangle patterns do those produce? <A HREF="PTAns2p3.html">Answer</A></P><P>4.
