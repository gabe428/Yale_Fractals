This is no surprise, because the polynomial for each row is obtained from the one above by multiplying by <NOBR>(1 + x + x<SUP>2</SUP>).</NOBR>  The x<SUP>2</SUP> term guarantees each row contains two more boxes than the row above it.  Consequently these shapes cannot be identical with the standardPascal's triangles: at the very least, they will be distorted versions of the standard. </P><P>The left picture is not a distortion of the standard Pascal's triangle shading the odd terms, but the right picture is a distortion of the standard Pascal's triangle shaading the terms congruent to <NOBR>1 or 2 (mod 3).</NOBR></P><P>Return to <A HREF="PTExerc5.html">Other polynomials Exercises</A>.</P></BODY>
