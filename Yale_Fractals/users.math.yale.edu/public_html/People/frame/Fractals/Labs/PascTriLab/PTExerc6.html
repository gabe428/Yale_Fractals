The number in each box is determined by numbers in two or more boxes of the row above.  This should be made to be simulated by CA.  In some way it is, and as long as we are interested only in even-or-odd distinctions, this is fairly straightforward to do using binary CA.  See the CA section of <A HREF="OtherQuest.html">other questions</A>, for an example.</P><P>When we ask for mods other than 2, the problem becomes more challenging with binary CA.  Can binary CA with larger neighborhoods reproduce the behavior of CA with more states and smaller neighborhoods?  See what you can find.</P><P>Binary problems should be accessible with binary CA.  Here is one exercise, for practice.</P><P>1. Find a CA to reproduce the pattern obtained by shading the odd numbers in Pascal's triangle for <NOBR>(1 + x + x<SUP>2</SUP>)<SUP>n</SUP>.</NOBR>  Hint: look again at the CA example in <A HREF="OtherQuest.html">other questions</A>.  <A HREF="PTAns6p1.html">Answer</A>.</P><P>Return to <A HREF="PTExercises.html">Exercises</A>.</P></BODY>
