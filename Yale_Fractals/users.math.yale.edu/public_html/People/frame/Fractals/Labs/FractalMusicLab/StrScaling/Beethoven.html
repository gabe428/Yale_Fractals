Here we investigate an example from the second movement of Beethoven's 7<SUP>th</SUP> Symphony, whichmay exhibit fractal structure with respect to phrasing.  Stay tuned for future developments.</TD></TR><TR><TD>This composition is, however, substantially more involved and correspondingly difficult to explain.  Fortunately, its rich harmonies appear to facilitate hearing different levels of scaling with respect to phrasing.</TD></TR><TR><TD>In this case we will begin on the level of one measure.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Because the symphony is written in <NOBR>2/4,</NOBR> this corresponds to two beats of music.</TD></TR><TR><TD>As in the Bach example, the first four measures go from tonic to dominant, followed by dominant to tonic.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>A<SUP>min</SUP></TD><TD>&nbsp E &nbsp</TD><TD>&nbsp E &nbsp</TD><TD>A<SUP>min</SUP></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>This progression sets up a pattern of what is often referred to as <I>tension-release</I>.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Moving from tonic to dominant gives rise to tension while moving back from dominant to tonic provides release.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Although the composition moves through many chordal changes, the sense of alternating movement we find in the first four measures gives us an indication of how we can divide the composition into natural and complementary phrases.</TD></TR><TR><TD>This map represents the first 16 measures of the piece.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Each side of the <FONT COLOR="FIREBRICK"><B>red triangular</B></FONT> trace corresponds to 1 measure; <FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>blue sides</B></FONT> are 2 measures; <FONT COLOR="GOLD"><B>gold sides</B></FONT> are 4 measures; and each <FONT COLOR="GREEN"><B>green side</B></FONT> is 8 measures.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Follow the traces from left to right, the vertices of each trace correspond to a transition between tension and release points.</TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Beethoven.gif" WIDTH=636 HEIGHT=380></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE><TR><TD>Excerpt </TD><TD><embed src="beet16.mid" autostart=false  width = "144" height="60"></TD><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Full second movement  </TD><TD><embed src="beetfull.mid" autostart=false  width = "144" height="60"></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">Sequenced by H.-J.
