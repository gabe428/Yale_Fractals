Then x cannot belong to any of the middle third intervals removed.</P><P>Suppose I is an interval centered on x.</P><P>I cannot be contained in any of the middle third intervals removed (else x would not be in C), yet it must intersect some of these intervals (the removed intervals account for <A HREF="NoIntervals.html">all the length</A> of the original interval).</P><P>Consequently, I must contain some endpoints of removed intervals.</P><P>Can I contain only one endpoint?  No, because for each endpoint only one side is the interval removed.  The side not removed at this stage is nibbled away by other removed intervals, some of whose endpoints must lie in I.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="LimitPoint.gif" WIDTH=369 HEIGHT=88></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="MTSConstr.html">Cantor set construction</A>.</P></BODY>
