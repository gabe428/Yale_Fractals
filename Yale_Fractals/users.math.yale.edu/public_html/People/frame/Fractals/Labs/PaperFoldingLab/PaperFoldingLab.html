Some represent fractals, others do not.  Mathematical questions can be asked about some; all can be enjoyed visually.</P><P>Here are some questions that can be asked for all the constructions presented here, and for their variations.  We provide solutions for the <A HREF="PFLProcSierp.html">Sierpinski gasket</A> example.</P><UL>1. (a) Compute the lengths of the cuts, assuming the process is continued for infinitely many steps, producing the <I>limiting shape</I>.  Here is the <A HREF="PFLAns1a.html">answer</A>.</UL><UL>(b) Compute the length of the edges of the limiting shape.  (Each cut creates three edges, each fold creates one.)  Here is the <A HREF="PFLAns1b.html">answer</A>.</UL><UL>2. Folding creates some open sides.  Suppose these are covered with paper squares.  Find the area of the limiting shape.  Here is the <A HREF="PFLAns2.html">answer</A>.</UL><UL>3. Find the volume of the limiting shape.  Here is the <A HREF="PFLAns3.html">answer</A>.</UL><UL>4. Is there a relation between edge length, area, and volume of the limiting shape?  </UL><P>Here are three pictures from our summer, 2002, workshop.
