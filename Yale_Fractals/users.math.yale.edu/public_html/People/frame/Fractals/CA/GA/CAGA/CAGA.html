The density of live cells is a global property, but CA rules are local.  To solve this problem, a CA must transmit information across space and time, and remember results of previous generations.  These are the characteristics of Class IV CA.</TD></TR>  <TR><TD>Here are the basic steps of the Genetic Algorithm approach to solving Density of Live Cells Problem.</TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE><TR><TD>* &nbsp The initial population consists of randomly distributed CA rules.</TD></TR><TR><TD>* &nbsp Each CA is tested against the same set of random initial generations with different densities of live cells.</TD></TR><TR><TD>* &nbsp The fitnness of each CA is the average of how close to the target state it comes for each initial generation.</TD></TR><TR><TD>More fit CA survive and reproduce by crossover and occasional mutation; less fit are removed from the population.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD>Here is an <A HREF="CAGAExample.html">example</A>.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P>Return to <A HREF="../GA.html">Genetic Algorithms</A>.</P></BODY>
