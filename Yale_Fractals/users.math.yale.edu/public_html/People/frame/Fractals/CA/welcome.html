Cellular Automata and Fractal Evolution</H1><TABLE><TD ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="CAEx1.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=484 HEIGHT=222></TABLE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cellular automata (CA) are abstract mathematical machines inspired by the question "Can a machine build a copy of itself?"  Defined by very simple rules, CA can produce a considerable variety of behaviors, including some that appear organic, and also many that are fractal.  CA are a convenient setting for exploring genetic algorithms, a powerful computer science application of a major biological paradigm.  Some of the patterns that apppear here also arise in music and in history, pointing to fractal aspects in those fields.<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contents of this page: <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><TABLE BORDER><TD><B>A</B>. <A HREF="SelfRepl/SelfRepl.html">The Paradox of Self-Replicating Machines</A> Can a machine make a copy of itself?  Before the mechanism for the replication of DNA was discovered, some thought self-reproduction could not be explained mechanically.  Von Neumann's resolution of this problem led to the field of Artificial Life.<TD><IMG SRC="SelfRepl/SelfReplS.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=110><TR><TD><B>B</B>. <A HREF="CABasics/CABasics.html">Cellular Automata Basics</A> What are CA?  How do they work?  How do we build a simple universe in a computer?<TD><IMG SRC="CABasics/CABasicsS.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=102 HEIGHT=37><TR><TD><B>C</B>. <A HREF="CAPatterns/CAPatterns.html">Examples of Cellular Automata Patterns</A> Yet another way to grow gaskets, and other surprises.  Some cellular automata produce patterns whose time record is fractal; some others exhibit even more complicated behavior.<TD><IMG SRC="CAPatterns/CASensitivity/CAS1E1S.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=58><TR><TD><B>D</B>. <A HREF="GA/GA.html">Genetic Algorithms and Artificial Evolution</A> A message from biology to computer science.

A map of the fitness of genotypes reveals not only multiple peaks, but a fractal distribution of peaks.  This has implications for evolutionary strategies.<TD><IMG SRC="FractalFitness/FractalFitnessS.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=87><TR><TD><B>F</B>. <A HREF="OneOverF/OneOverF.html">1/f Noise</A> Scalings in CA, evolution, and elsewhere.  This scaling, that the size of events falls off as roughly the reciprocal of the frequency of the events, is present in a wide variety of settings, yet the source of this behavior remains unclear.<TD><IMG SRC="OneOverF/OneOverFS.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=104 HEIGHT=53><TR><TD><B>G</B>. <A HREF="../Panorama/Music/Mus/Music.html">Music including 1/f</A> Voss and Clarke observed 1/f scalings in many kinds of music, and in music from different cultures.  Because many natural processes exhibit 1/f scaling, this may be a way music imitates nature.<TD><IMG SRC="OneOverFMusicS.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=86 HEIGHT=53><TR><TD><B>H</B>. <A HREF="../Panorama/SocialSciences/History/History.html">Fractals in History</A> There is some evidence that the distribution of conflicts, and of other major events, exhibit 1/f scaling.  But perhaps other hierarchical structures are present in the fabric of history.

Depending on focus, zoom, and the direction of the camera, complex patterns may appear.  Is this an analog version of CA?<TD><IMG SRC="Videofeedback/VideoFeedbackS.html" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=75><TR><TD><B>J</B>. <A HREF="../Panorama/Biology/Leopard/Leopard.html">How the Leopard Gets Its Spots</A> A biological expression of CA principles appears to be responsible for the formation of the leopard's spots.

One of the cornerstones of Artificial Intelligence (AI), neural nets are good at learning and at genralizing.
