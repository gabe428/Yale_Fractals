That there are is most easily established by showing the set of all endpoints is countable, while the Cantor set is uncountable.)</P>  <P>Again, take k large enough that 1/3<SUP>k</SUP> < d.</P>  <P>Because q belongs to C<SUB>i</SUB> for all i, q belongs to C<SUB>k</SUB>, hence to an interval L of C<SUB>k</SUB>.</P>  <P>Let w be either of the endpoints of L.</P>  <P>Then w is not q (the hypothesis of this second case) so 0 < <NOBR>dist(w, q)</NOBR>.</P>  <P>Because both w and q belong to L, <NOBR>dist(w, q)</NOBR> < 1/3<SUP>k</SUP> < d.</P>  <P>Consequently, q is a limit point of the Cantor set.</P>     <P>Combining these two steps, we have shown that every point of the Cantor set is a limit point of the Cantor set.</P>  <P>To complete this example, we must show that every limit point of the Cantor set belongs to the Cantor set.</P>  <P>Suppose q is a limit point of the Cantor set.</P>  <P>For the purpose of contradiction, suppose q does not belong to the Cantor set.</P>  <P>Then q must belong to <NOBR>(-infinity, 0)</NOBR>, to <NOBR>(1, infinity)</NOBR>, or to one of the open intervals removed in going from some C<SUB>i</SUB> to C<SUB>i+1</SUB>.</P>  <P>That is, q belongs to some open interval <NOBR>(a, b)</NOBR> disjoint from the Cantor set.</P>  <P>Let d be the smaller of the distances <NOBR>dist(q, a)</NOBR> and <NOBR>dist(q, b)</NOBR>.</P>  <P>Then no point of the Cantor set lies within a distance d of q, so q cannot be a limit point of the Cantor set.</P>      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Return to <A HREF = "LimSetExs.html">limit set examples</A>.</P></BODY>
